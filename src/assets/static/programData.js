      "ProgramSummary": "There’s a whole world of fascinating subjects to explore and in this six-part series Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin, Kathriona Devereux and Jonathan McCrea face up to their fears, undergo a series of stress tests, challenge themselves to push through the pain barrier, and examine the finer workings of the brain – all in the name of science!\r\nIn a brave attempt to investigate the underlying reasons behind our phobias, Aoibhinn gets up close and personal with some (rather large!) spiders to better understand and perhaps even overcome her arachnophobia. Jonathan wilfully submits himself for some ‘water-boarding’ and uncovers some disturbing truths about the neuroscience of torture.\r\nWhile world-leading researchers in Cork take on the seemingly unflappable Kathriona to reveal some fascinating connections between our mood… and our food! And in a battle of the sexes, will it be Jonathan or Aoibhinn who comes out on top of a pain threshold test? ",

      "ProgramSummary": "The latest instalment of ITV’s landmark documentary series returns to visit the people whose lives have been followed since they were just seven-years-old.\r\nThe original '7 Up' was broadcast in 1964 as a one-off World in Action Special featuring children chosen from different backgrounds to talk about their hopes and dreams for the future. The series was inspired by World in Action founder editor Tim Hewat’s interest in both the saying: \"Give me the child until he is seven and I will show you the man,\" and the rigid class system of 1960s Britain\r\n7 Up set out to discover whether or not the children’s lives were pre-determined by their background.\r\nDirector Michael Apted, who has since moved to Hollywood to direct films including 'The World Is Not Enough', 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'Gorillas in the Mist', has returned every seven years to chart the children’s progress through life. Over the past six decades, the series has documented the group as they have become adults and entered middle-age, dealing with everything life has thrown at them in between. \r\nNow, called '56 Up', the series is back to discover what has happened to the group over the last seven years.

They have dealt with prejudice, they have been overlooked, they have been made to feel out of place. But they have picked themselves up and they have proven themselves time and time again. The Kanneh-Masons light up every room they enter and they have found this to ensure the support of people like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who invited Sheku to play at their wedding, and Elton John, who supported Isata with a scholarship. This film accompanies this family on their path and join them on and behind the stages of the world as they conquer it together, as they grow into their own as a family of talented musicians. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "In August, 1881 Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greely and a team of 25 determined men set out as part of the First International Polar Year to build a research station on Ellesmere Island, 450 miles from the North Pole. The Lady Franklin Bay Expedition began as the most ambitious arctic expedition in United States history, but was destined to descend into a three year journey through a frozen hell- a voyage of forced retreat, starvation, brewing mutiny and cannibalism. Against all odds, six men survived and returned to Portsmouth, NH as American heroes.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Clark became fascinated with the Greely story after an adventure tour he took with his family in 1988 to Ellesmere Island. After 3 preparatory trips to the High Arctic, he organized an expedition in 2004 to retrace the Greely story by kayak, with a crew of scientists, field guides and Greely's great, great grandson, producing the documentary film Abandoned in the Arctic.  The data collected and research done by Greely's Lady Franklin Bay expedition is still relevant today, in light of growing concerns by scientists about climate change and global warming.",

      "ProgramSummary": "In AfroPop: The Ultimate Cultural Exchange kicks off its landmark Season 15 on the WORLD Channel, Mon., May 1, 2022 and online at WORLD and PBS. This year's thematic anthology focuses exclusively on the arts. We showcase five feature length films about individuals, well-known and hidden, who have forged new avenues of expression through their creativity. The series opens with Can You Bring It: Bill T. Jones and D-Man in the Waters, a Rosalynde LeBlanc documentary that reimagines and traces the history of one of the most important works of art to come out of the age of AIDS - Bill T. Jones' tour de force ballet \"D-Man in the Waters.Ã¢â‚¬Â In episode two, Claire Duguet's documentary Queen Kidjo, explores the epic career and international impact of Benin singer Angelique Kidjo. Episode three features Jeffrey Wolf's Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts, which explores the life of a unique American artist, who in his late 80s, became homeless and started to draw and paint, both his memories from plantation days and scenes of a radically changing urban culture. Episode four showcases Sara de GouveiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sound of Masks about a dancer who performs Mapiko, a traditional masked dance done exclusively by the male members of the Makonde community living in northern Mozambique. During the Mozambican War of Independence in the 1960s, this dance became a tool to challenge colonization. The season wraps with Alain GomisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rewind & Play which brings to light the lack of respect with which the legendary jazz musician Thelonious Monk was treated in Autumn, 1969, when at the end of his European tour, he appeared on an interview show in Paris for French state television.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "From akadocpomus.com\r\n\r\nParalyzed with polio as a child, Brooklyn-born Jerome Felder reinvented himself first as a blues singer, renaming himself Doc Pomus, then emerged as a one of the most brilliant songwriters of the early rock and roll era, writing “Save the Last Dance for Me,” “This Magic Moment,” “A Teenager in Love,” “Viva Las Vegas,” and dozens of other hits. For most of his life Doc was confined to crutches and a wheelchair, but he lived more during his sixty-five years than others could experience in several lifetimes. A.K.A. DOC POMUS brings to life Doc’s joyous, romantic, heartbreaking, and extraordinarily eventful journey. In his later years, Doc was a mentor to generations of younger songwriters, and a fierce advocate for downtrodden rhythm and blues musicians. He wrote a thousand songs – including some of the most recorded songs in the history of popular music – but his most lasting gift may have been his uniquely generous spirit.  “If the music industry had a heart,” the record producer Jerry Wexler remembered, “it would be Doc Pomus.”Packed with incomparable music and rare archival imagery, A.K.A. DOC POMUS features interviews with Doc’s collaborators and friends, including Dr. John, Ben E. King, Joan Osborne, Shawn Colvin, Dion, Leiber and Stoller, and B.B. King. Passages from Doc’s private journals are read by his close friend, Lou Reed. Doc Pomus’ gripping life story makes for a powerful and lively film that introduces this unique American character to a new, much wider circle of admirers. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Vanity Fair described Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) as \"a national treasure ... a part of British comedy heritage as John Cleese's Basil Fawlty and Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean.\"[34] According to Variety, in Britain \"Alan Partridge is a full-on phenomenon, a multiplatform fictional celebrity whose catchphrases, mangled metaphors and social ineptitude are the stuff of legend and good ratings. The character is less well known outside the UK, but according to Anchorman director Adam McKay, \"every American comic knows who Steve is, whether it's Stiller or Ferrell or Jack Black or me ... and everyone watching those [Partridge] DVDs had the same reaction. How did I not know about this guy?\" Indiewire wrote that \"few Americans may know, but Partridge is a something of a comic icon across the pond ... Before there was Ron Burgundy for the Yanks, there was Alan Partridge for the Brits.\r\n\r\nThis one off special follows Alan as he attempts to make amends for a controversial on-air incident as he heads to the north on a \"deeply personal journey of redemption\".  He takes it upon himself to investigate if a 'schasm' - a schism or chasm - has formed between the north and south, \"the have and have-nots\". \r\nOne-off, spoof documentary in which Steve Coogan's perennially over-reaching broadcaster heads to the nebulous `north' to see how the other half live. Seeking to make amends for a controversial on-air gaffe, in which Alan apparently managed to offend anyone who considers themselves a `northerner', Norwich's finest sets out to immerse himself in the lives of the very people he slighted, as he investigates what he refers to as the `schasm' between the UK's haves and the have-nots, perhaps even transforming himself into a sought-after TV star in the process. \r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Aldwyth is an artist who defies categorization: she is a painter, a sculptor, a box constructionist, and, for the past twenty years, an intricate collagist. Oriane Stender describes her as \"a voracious collector, scrupulous cataloguer, encyclopedic archivist, sly social commentator and corrective art-historian.\" Aldwyth's work, according to Stender, \"reflects influences from folk art and craft; obsessive outsider art; modernism, Dada and Surrealism; gender politics; and everything else going on in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnd like her artwork the trajectory of Aldwyth's artistic life has been anything but simple. This film, Aldwyth: Fully Assembled, follows Aldwyth's remarkable creative journey; documenting her challenges and obstacles; and telling the story of her life's inspiring \"second act\" and how she became the singular artist she is today.\r\n\r\nBased in South Carolina, much of Aldwyth's creative life was influenced by her surroundings in and around Hilton Head. Aldwyth would often stop by now-celebrated outsider artist Sam Doyle's home, finding his paintings laid out on his front lawn. Aldwyth's conversations with Sam kindled an artistic spark in her, but it would be decades - until she was 40 years old - before she could act upon it. \r\n\r\nFor much of her early life, Aldwyth was married to a man who prevented her from making art.  As she says, \"art was competition\" for her attention and her husband demanded her full attention. To sate her thwarted artistic impulses, she created clothes for her three sons and painted for their school auctions. After two decades of marriage, she divorced and immediately carved out a new life for herself pursuing painting in every spare moment and working as a housecleaner to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nIt was during this time, Aldwyth says, that her \"real\" art education began.  Between 1980-1995, she was a member of the historic Red Piano Round Table on Hilton Head. Composed mostly of retired New York City illustrators (the real life \"Mad Men\"), including Joe Bowler and Coby Whitmore, this group met every Thursday to discuss all things art related. This education was vital to Aldwyth's creative growth. Importantly, The Red Piano Gallery gave Aldwyth her first solo show in 1987.  \r\n\r\nAnother turning point came in 1989, after Hurricane Hugo hit South Carolina, when Aldwyth began collecting bits of shutters blown off houses and other wreckage on the beach from the storm. She transformed this collected debris into three dimensional artworks. In 1996, Aldwyth settled on an art form that she continues working on to this day: collage.  Her highly original, monumental collages are now owned by the South Carolina State Museum, The Ackland Museum in NC, and the Jepson Tellfair Museum in GA, among others. Throughout the years, she has been awarded many residencies and grants, and, in 2009, a major exhibit of her work was shown at the Halsey Art Institute in Charleston, SC. This was her first retrospective, at age 73.\r\n",

Claude Debussyâ€™s impressionist masterpiece La Mer (â€œThe Seaâ€) portrays the ever-changing sea in its many moods and colors.\r\n \r\n503\tVienna Dreams and Barcelona Visions\r\nAn unforgettable love-story set in a Vienna of long ago comes alive in Richard Straussâ€™ opera Der Rosenkavalier (The Cavalier of the Rose), arranged as a symphonic suite by Gerard Schwarz. The spiritual beauty of Barcelonaâ€™s towering cathedral, La Sagrada Familia, is evoked by Adolphus Hailstorkâ€™s musical meditation Sagrada.\r\n \r\n504\tâ€œFree but Happyâ€ â€“ Brahmsâ€™ 3rd Symphony\r\nJohannes Brahms expressed his own enigmatic motto, â€œfree but happy,â€ in musical symbols that weave throughout this beautiful, deeply personal symphony â€“ one of the greatest works of German romanticism. The program opens with Hector Berliozâ€™ witty Shakespearean overture to Beatrice and Benedict.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "This film explores the work of photographer Titus Brooks HeaginsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the challenging questions his photos pose about the systemic and casual exclusions and neglect of societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most vulnerable communities of color.\r\n\r\nHumanizing, reverent, and confrontational, TitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ photographs document the overlooked: people who, usually through some intersection of poverty, race or gender/sexual identity, exist as outsiders. He describes his work as Ã¢â‚¬Å“confront[ing] viewers in their personal spaces to move the position of Ã¢â‚¬Å“othernessÃ¢â‚¬Â closer to a normative construction of self.Ã¢â‚¬Â\r\n\r\nA large body of TitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work focuses on trans people, whom he has photographed in the US and in Cuba since 2016. As a cisgendered African American man in his 70s, TitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship to these communities is complex and controversial, a topic the film examines as he draws connection to his experiences of being bullied, and othered, as a child.\r\n\r\nTitusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ photos are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian, Duke UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nasher Museum, and the North Carolina Museum of Art. Yet today he still seeks to be known in broader circles and, at 72, struggles to get his artwork into public spaces.\r\n\r\nThrough verite footage following Titus into the field, plus interviews with family, colleagues and mentees, this film examines a complex, talented, passionate and compassionate figure, illuminating the fortitude it takes to be an outsider documenting outsiders. As is necessary in this moment, this film also probes the question of Ã¢â‚¬Å“who can tell whose story?Ã¢â‚¬Â while a spotlight on an overlooked, but richly deserving, artist.",

Recorded before a live audience at the Second Baptist Church in Bloomington, Indiana, Dr. Raymond Wise leads the Indiana University African American Choral Ensemble in a performance of sacred music spanning from African traditions to contemporary praise and worship music.\r\n\r\nMuch of the Black experience has been defined and uplifted by the Black church, with gospel and religious music as a form of self-expression. Amen! Music of the Black Church speaks to the optimism and triumph embodied in this musical genre. Vignettes woven throughout the performance featuring narrative interviews with historic highlights and stylized visuals that give context to the music featured in the program.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "In the U.S. where more women die in childbirth than any other wealthy nationÃ¢â‚¬â€the joys of pregnancy and motherhood are often overshadowed by fear. Amid a growing maternal health crisis, especially for women of color, American Delivery is a documentary that tells the story of the glimmers of hope: women finding their voice and autonomy; nurses listening to women and offering birth choices; and hospital leaders welcoming the community as the patient. The film interweaves the stories of women and their families across the U.S. as they navigate the challenges of pregnancy, mental health, childbirth, and the postpartum period. It paints a joyous portrait of the moment babies come into the world, and the heroic efforts of families and communities to catch new mothers before they fall through the broken health safety net.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Mary Bruno spent her childhood along a toxic stretch of one of the most neglected waterways in America.  Decades later, she returns to kayak the river of her youth and tell its story.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN RIVER is a new 86-minute documentary that follows Ms. Bruno and guide Carl Alderson on a 4-day, 80-mile adventure down New Jersey's Passaic River, from its pristine source in a wildlife refuge to its toxic mouth in Newark Bay. With breathtaking cinematography, the river's extraordinary history, geology and ecology are revealed as the kayakers navigate challenges, travel through urban landscapes and head towards the industrial disaster that poisoned the Passaic for the past 60 years. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, the filmmakers engage residents, historians and advocates in candid conversations that bring insight, urgency and a sense of wonder to the story. How did the Passaic become one of the most contaminated rivers in America?  Can it be saved? The Passaic is an archetype for thousands of rivers across America facing similar reckonings.\r\n\r\nThree years in the making, AMERICAN RIVER was directed by seasoned filmmaker Scott Morris and based on Mary Bruno's 2012 book, \"An American River: From Paradise to Superfund.\" Like the book, the film is a unique blend of personal memoir, adventure, history and science. The entire journey was captured in grand and intimate scale from the water, land and air by an experienced crew with ten 4K cameras. An original score, high-end graphics and rare archival images enhance the story.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Amish are one of the most surprising communities in the United States. Living as they did in the 17th century, they have no electricity or running water and travel by horse-drawn carriage. Mostly farmers, they lead an austere existence in near autarky. For them, only the word of the Lord counts, and they follow the biblical principles to the letter, inspired by their founder, Jacob Amman.\r\n \r\nHow can they live between an ancestral ideology and a civilization of consumption pushed to the extreme? What does it mean, in the 21st century, to live according to 400-year-old rules?\r\n \r\nThis film offers a rare immersion in a community reputed to be the most closed in the world, in a frozen world where the old remains the absolute reference in the face of a modernity judged to be \"vitiated\". Three generations of Amish agreed to tell their stories after months of reflection and debate with their pastors! They are among the most conservative. Their words are rare.\r\n \r\nBeyond the simple cleavage between the archaic way of life and the modern world, this documentary also raises other issues such as the notion of individual freedom, belonging to a minority, the questioning of an economic and social model and of course, the place of women.",

      "ProgramSummary": "One September evening at the Birchmere Music Hall in 2015, thirty of DC's finest musicians gathered to celebrate their heroes and display the virtuosic, genre-blending music they proudly call their own. In the center of the stage stood a Fender Telecaster, which was the late Danny Gatton's signature instrument. As the undisputed master of this music, Gatton would blend jazz, blues, country, swing, rock, and bluegrass - sometimes in the same solo. He grew up in the DC neighborhood of Anacostia, and gave it's name to this musical culture unique to DC - \"The Anacostia Delta.\"\r\n\r\nProduced by the film-making team of director Bryan Reichhardt, producer Suzanne Brindamour Tolford and cinematographer Mathieu Mazza, \"Anacostia Delta: The Legacy of DC's TeleMasters\" explores the universe of live music that permeated the culture of Washington, D.C. in the post-WWII era.  \"Every kind of music found a home here,\" says concert music director John Previti, who was born and raised in the area and was Gatton's bassist for 19 years. \"The Route 301 corridor had clubs, Georgetown had clubs, downtown DC had clubs. They were everywhere, and you could hear every kind of music played by the very best.\"\r\n\r\nThe concert program traces the development of the Anacostia Delta scene and celebrates the grand guitar masters Gatton and Roy Buchanan, as well as unsung heroes, like Chick Hall, the influential owner of Bladensburg, Maryland's Surf Club. The concert features stalwarts and leading lights of DC's music scene, including Dave Chappell, Anthony Pirog, Billy Hancock, Steve Wolf, and Tom Principato, among many others, and celebrates the musicians who are carrying the Anacostia Delta tradition forward.  In between acts, the film presents interviews with the performers and gives viewers a look at their rehearsals leading up to the concert.   \r\n\r\nIn addition, viewers are taken back in time with archival footage and interviews with family, friends, bandmates, and celebrities who understand DC's influential yet not-widely-known musicians. Nashville superstar Vince Gill states it simply: \"I think a lot of people would perceive this to not be a hotbed of a music community like Nashville or Austin or L.A. or New York, but it was. It was every bit as good as anywhere else in the country you could ever go. Tons of great musicians from around here and all the musicians knew it - maybe the rest of the world didn't but we all did.\"   In addition to Gill, the film also features interviews with internationally recognized guitarists and fans of Gatton and Buchanan, including Nils Lofgren, Albert Lee and Mike Stern. Lofgren grew up in suburban DC and was mentored by Buchanan. The longtime lead guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street band, Lofgren says, \"Looking back, and having traveled extensively, I still feel like Washington had one of the better music scenes in the country and I think still does.\" \r\n\r\n\"We're celebrating a genre that doesn't get much attention in the world,\" says director Reichhardt.  \"And we want to bring attention to it. It deserves that attention.\"\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "This documentary is the story of an Afghan refugee, Anahita, who is resettling in Minneapolis. Anahita was a police officer in Kabul. She was evacuated in August 2021 with her five children, after being tipped off that the Taliban was looking for her. Her husband did not make it out of Afghanistan. Anahita tells the harrowing story of getting into the airport, climbing over barbed wire, almost being shot by the Taliban, and the challenge of keeping her children safely by her side throughout the ordeal. She arrived at Fort Dix in New Jersey, where immigration officials began the process of resettling her. It was there that she met Amy, who would eventually become her sponsor. Shortly after arriving at Fort Dix, Anahita discovered she was pregnant. Amy, a mother of two, invited Anahita to come home with her to Minneapolis. Anahita's sixth child was born in May in Minneapolis. Now, with Amy's help, Anahita is working to raise her children, learning English, and trying to build a future for herself and her children in the United States.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The compelling six-hour series ANCIENT ROADS FROM CHRIST TO CONSTANTINE charts Christianity's evolution from a small movement to the largest religion in the world, with more than two billion followers. Host Jonathan Phillips, an author and distinguished history professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, journeys into the fascinating world of the early Christians to explore the faith's long struggle and triumph against the odds. He recounts some of Christianity's pivotal moments at the actual locations where they unfolded, including Bethlehem (site of Jesus' birth), Judea (where Jesus preached) and Rome (where Emperor Constantine the Great embraced the faith as his own), among others. Phillips' entertaining and enlightening 12,000-mile odyssey through seven countries in Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East brings the rich history of Christianity to life. Along the way, he meets experts who have devoted their lives to the study of this important historical period. \r\n \r\nJonathan Phillips is a frequent consultant and on-air presence for BBC radio, BBC television and the History Channel. He has authored numerous books on the Crusades, including the recently published Holy Warriors: A Modern History of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nEpisodes:\r\n\"Birth of a Faith\"\r\nWith the Gospels as his guide, Phillips traces Jesus' journey from birth to resurrection.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Missionary\"\r\nPhillips recounts the Apostle Paul's bold quest to bring the Christian message to Asia and Europe, a journey during which he was imprisoned, beaten and nearly killed.\r\n\r\n\"Age of the Apostles\"\r\nIn the third episode, Phillips retraces Paul's third and final missionary journey. The Apostolic Age ends with Paul and Peter both meeting their fate at the hands of one of the cruelest tyrants in history.\r\n\r\n\"From Apocalypse to Heresies\"\r\nEpisode four opens in a Jerusalem rocked by war. Phillips travels to Patmos Island ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â the site of John's exile ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and visits the cave where the apostle wrote the most enigmatic book of the New Testament, Revelation. He also visits the site where powerful heretics claiming special knowledge of Jesus threatened to distort, divide and even destroy the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n\"Pagans and the Cult of Martyrs\"\r\nIn North Africa, Phillips tells the story of a young Christian martyr named Perpetua. He also visits places where Christians faced violent persecution because of their beliefs and other sites where the Roman Empire threatened Christianity's core values. \r\n\r\n\"Constantine\"\r\nIn the final installment, Rome exerts its fullest effort to eradicate Christianity ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and fails. The conversion of Constantine the Great would fully transform the fortunes of the Christian faith,  making it the official religion of the Roman Empire.",

But a barrier lies between the kids and their Ancestors: 200 years of colonial suppression that smashed their boats, scattered their technologies and reduced their words to whispers. The Camp is part of the race against time to repatriate and reawaken Sugpiaq knowledge and culture, and point a path to the future. ",

It's a celebration of our multi-cultural community! Say hello to Clarice you've entered the world of the Urban Nutcracker. Strains of Duke Ellington dovetail with the buzz of neon, driven by the heartbeat of Tchaikovsky. You could say it is a fusion of modern, multicultural and classical dance....But it's more! It's an organic interpretation brought about by a unifying of cultures. This is how art succeeds. This is why classic ballet, urban tap, hip hop, swing, flamenco, step and jazz blend into something special.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Of both Inupiaq and Norwegian descent, Apayauq grew up between Norway and the far reaches of northern Alaska in Kaktovik, learning from a young age to dogsled with her father. In 2019 she completed her first Iditarod registered as a man and won Rookie of the Year at the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest Race, experiencing varying degrees of gender dysphoria throughout both races. On March 8th, 2021, Apayauq officially came out as trans, posting on Instagram â€œIâ€™m a trans woman, I use she/her pronouns. I'm much happier in everyday life now that I'm living true to myself. I've been sure of this for a long time, and I've been wearing skirts and makeup and only using my Inupiaq name for many months since I was named after my great grandma. Happy International Women's Day.â€ In 2022 she returned to the Iditarod, this time competing as a woman. Filmmaker Zeppelin Zeerip followed along for the journey, snowmobiling alongside her for over 1,000 miles, documenting Apayauqâ€™s experience and her coming to terms with her gender.\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "93-year-old John Miley of Evansville, Ind., has compiled the largest collection of sports broadcasts in the country. He began making recordings in 1947, while he was a high school student. Nearly eight decades later, his collection now includes more than 44,000 recordings of radio and TV sports broadcasts.\r\n\r\nâ€œI had no idea what I was doing, really,â€ Miley said. â€œWhat I was trying to do was I knew that when I retired I would want something to do, and whatâ€™s better to do than listen to old sporting events.â€\r\n\r\nArchiving Airwaves: The Miley Collection explores Mileyâ€™s extensive collection, which includes every Super Bowl, a half-century of the Kentucky Derby and Indianapolis 500 races, the World Series games from 1954 to the present, and more. Other historical highlights of his collection feature the Brooklyn Dodgersâ€™ final game; the heavyweight title fights between Joe Louis and Billy Conn; Roger Marisâ€™s 61st home run in 1961; and the fourth quarter of Wilt Chamberlainâ€™s 100-point performance in 1962. Miley also has the play-by-plays of famous sportscasters, such as Mel Allen, Red Barber, Ted Husing, Harry Caray, Ernie Harwell, Vin Scully, and Bill Stern.\r\n\r\nArchiving Airwaves reveals how Miley came to the decision to donate his entire archive to the National Sports Journalism Center at the Indiana University Media School. The program looks at the Media Schoolâ€™s plans for digitization to make the collection available as a resource for students and the public. â€œThis is a history of sports broadcasting in the United States over the last century,â€ said Galen Clavio, the director of IUâ€™s National Sports Journalism Center.",

      "ProgramSummary": "There is no doubt that art can make us feel better. Listening to a beautiful sonnet, experiencing the lilting melodies of an orchestra, or feeling inspiration from viewing a boldly colored painting, even witnessing the beauty in nature, can make the us feel profoundly different in a positive manner. That is because it is scientifically proven that the arts are essential to our well-being. \r\n\r\nThe neuro-arts is the scientific study of how the arts measurably transforms the brain and the body through artistic and aesthetic expressions and experiences. Whether it be learning to use singing for stress relief, incorporating colors to create mood, or dancing to help stave off depression, Susan Magsamen, co-author of the New York Times best seller, \" Your Brain on Art,\" explains how the arts are healthy for body, brain and bliss. \r\n\r\nSusan, who also is the Founder and Executive Dir., Intl. Arts   Mind Lab, Center for Applied Neuroaesthetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, joins experts in their perspective fields of arts and psychology for this innovative and thought-provoking series of interstitials, entitled, \"The Art of Well-being.\" The interstitials explore the ways the brain interacts with art, helping viewers understand how aesthetic experiences can be applied toward enhancing our mental health, whether it be through dance lessons, a museum visit, or simply taking a walk through a beautiful forest. \r\n\r\nAs Susan Magsamen states, \"Curiosity, surprise and wonder are all important for human development.\" And that is what this series of interstitials attempts to prove, that through science, art is more than a nice visual hanging on a wall. It can be one of the most important keys to our well-being.\r\n\r\nEpisode Descriptions:\r\n\r\nEpisode 101: Spaces TRT 2:53\r\nArchitectural spaces using available light, curves and natural aesthetics are proving curative to mind and body when it come to mood, blood pressure and heart rate.  A quick delve into how creative and natural interior and exterior design elements help us feel safe, comfortable and all around happy. \r\n\r\nEpisode 102: Sound Therapy TRT 2:33\r\nVibrations create energy. Today therapists are tapping into those vibrations to cure specific mental health challenges and trauma. A look into how different sounds and instruments are being used to heal. \r\n\r\nEpisode 103: Nature Healing TRT 2:22\r\nFor years our ancestors for years have taken long nature walks to relieve stress and open their creative energies. This short segment examines how nature soothes and counterbalances anxiety. \r\n\r\nEpisode 104: The Art of Coloring TRT 2:33\r\nColoring has been studied in recent years to find out why this simple form of creativity can alleviate stress, make one feel calmer and more content. Studies have shown that coloring has a similar psychological response to our brains as the act of meditation because it reduces outside noise and allows focus.  This segment also delves into the types of colors and patterns that produce the most calming effects and why. \r\n\r\nEpisode 105: Poetic Medicine TRT 2:51\r\nHow does the oldest form of written literature effect our minds in such a profound manner? New research suggests that poetry, demonstrates the complexities with which our brain constructs the world in and around us, because it unifies thought , language, music, and imagery in a clear manageable way, more often with play, pleasure, and emotion. \r\n\r\nEpisode 106: Making and Keeping Memories Through Music TRT 2:48\r\nResearch shows that when music is incorporated into a lesson, children are more apt to retain the information. At the same time, for the older generation, therapists are using music to help bring back memories for those with dementia. \r\n\r\nEpisode 107: Dancing The Blues Away TRT 2:53\r\nDance has been shown to improve mood and help stave off depression by releasing serotonin. Movement increases neural activity between brain hemispheres and helps to develop new neural connections. \r\n\r\nEpisode 108: Social Prescribing TRT2:06\r\nExposing children to the arts offers their young minds more than an appreciation to the creative world. Social prescribing is when a therapist prescribes a form of immersive arts to a child such as singing classes for stress, museum visits for anxiety and nature walks for burnout. Immersing in the arts are proving to be a focused and curative method to cultivate well-being. Studies show that the kids engaged in the arts have fewer problems with their peers, teachers, and adults, and they are less likely to develop depression. \r\n\r\nEpisode 109: Make To Know TRT2:32\r\nMaking something with our hands has a profound effect on our ability to learn. It's a connection between the brain and the hand that supports an embodied cognition. Handicrafts for instance are now being used to develop focus, patience, dexterity, confidence, not to mention creativity. \r\n\r\nEpisode 110: Soothing Through Singing TRT 2:42\r\nFeeling low? Sing. Belting out a tune or joining a chorus reduces the stress hormone called cortisol. Singing is particularly healing for mothers suffering from post-partum depression. Singing also helps lull the fidgety baby to sleep which will help a nervous mom settle down making for a happy mom and happy baby. \r\n\r\nEpisode 111: Color Me Happy TRT 2:53\r\nColors are mood creators. In fact many interior designers have known for years that yellow agitates, blue soothes and pink can make you hungry. This segment looks at how colors influence our moods and how hospitals, schools and home designers are using this knowledge to create enriching environments.\r\n\r\nEpisode 112: Awestruck TRT 2:22\r\nAwe is embedded into our DNA. Think of the power of awe when we view a magnificent sunset or a shooting star. Many times, awe is manifested physically by shivering and an elevated pulse. This elation or euphoria often leads to heightened curiosity and creativity. It encourages us to move forward with new ideas. This Awestruck segment would explore how an incredible experience with art  can create awe that is measurable and constructive. \r\n\r\nEpisode 113: What are Neuro-Arts?  TRT 2:54\r\nThe neuro-arts is the scientific study of how the arts measurably transforms the brain and the body through artistic and aesthetic expressions and experiences. Whether it be learning to use singing for stress relief, incorporating colors to create mood or dancing to help stave off depression, Susan Magsamen, co-author of the New York Times best seller, \" Your Brain on Art,\" explains how the arts are healthy for body, brain, and bliss.

      "ProgramSummary": "From Dennis Allen:  \"Richard Tilkin, who, like us, has been in the biz for a million years.  I think it’s a worthy effort and my good deed for the season is to try to help him get the visibility for the piece that I think it deserves.  Appreciate any/all thoughts, not just APT related but any insight about who to talk to about distribution or where to look.  It’s made the Rhode Island Int Film Fest and has been accepted tothe upcoming Boston Film Fest.\"\r\n\r\nwww.aftdoc.com\r\n\r\nAside From That is a journey of discovery. We start with the premise that we all yearn for a bit of wisdom that might ease our path through life and our passage to whatever – if anything – lies beyond.\r\n\r\nWe want to test the idea that there is – to borrow a phrase – a BEST PRACTICE for thinking about our own mortality, an attitude or philosophy that might enable us to live our lives in a more meaningful way. To this end, we seek the perspectives of philosophers, academics, and clerics as well as “real” people from all walks of life. \r\n\r\nAmong those featured are:\r\n\r\nJoan Halifax, an American Buddhist, anthropologist and author of several books on Buddhism and spirituality, and a pioneer in end-of-life care\r\nLegendary comedian Steven Wright, known for his deadpan, mordant wit and trenchant observations on life and death.\r\n Dr. John Wynn of the Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, a board member of the Ernest Becker Foundation and frequent lecturer on death awareness and anxiety\r\n John B. Williamson, a professor of sociology at Boston College with a PhD from Harvard, author or co-author of 16 books on aging policy\r\nDr. Graeme Steele, a surgeon and oncologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and affiliate of Harvard Medical School\r\nGaynor Blandford, a professor at the Boston Conservatory and Emerson College, where she teaches a course on mortality \r\n\r\nBut at the heart of our film, illuminating universal themes of death, uncertainty and trauma are three people whose stories are extraordinary and unforgettable:\r\n\r\nBorn to Holocaust survivors in a displaced person’s camp at the end of WWII, and now facing an incurable degenerative disease, Rachel engages in a race against time to accomplish a highly unorthodox goal\r\nA native of Kansas, the Heartland of America, 20-year-old former cheerleader and pre-med student Meghan is living the quintessential American dream – until her world is rocked by a grave diagnosis and relapse with 50/50 odds of survival\r\nAn Iraq war veteran haunted by images of mutilation and death in a 24/7 nightmare from which there is no respite, Michaelstruggles to reconcile his self-proclaimed identity as a nihilist with his very real love for his girlfriend and daughter.\r\n\r\nWe also meet random pedestrians in cities from Seattle, Washington to Boston, Massachusetts, ambushed on their lunch hour with questions about death. \r\n\r\nRather than focusing on the hospice, lecture hall, scientific laboratory, or funeral industry, we probe the minds and lives of “real” people, searching, like the rest of us, for clues about how best to live, think and behave when rudely confronted with our own mortality. \r\n",

A number of children succumbed and the epidemic threatened to wipe out the entire population, as no medicines were to hand to counter the disease. The authorities realized that the only way to reach the stricken town with supplies of life-giving serum was by relays of dog teams, twenty in all, across a thousand kilometres of icy wastes.\r\nWith Balto in the lead, sled-driver Gunnar Kaasen, a Norwegian, set off together with his dogteam on the last gruelling leg to Nome in a blizzard that completely obliterated the trail they were following. Unerringly, however, Balto led the way, and the vital serum reached Nome in time to save the population from impending death.\r\nThe drama made the front page of every newspaper from Los Angeles to New York. Throughout the country, 'The Race Against Death' was on everybody's lips, and Balto rocketed to fame overnight. And the film that followed, Balto's Race to Nome, with Balto and Kaasen playing themselves, was likewise a runaway success.\r\n",

It examines Streisand’s rise to fame and how she shaped and influenced her entire artistic lineage, while embodying the cause of women and gay people.\r\nToday's powerful pop divas - Madonna, Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga, and Beyoncé and so on - trace their descent back to the mother of all Queen Bees: Barbra Streisand.\r\nStreisand's achievements rank her among the Hollywood greats. Her acting, singing and dancing talents have won her numerous awards including two Oscars, nine Golden Globes, ten Grammys and five Emmys. The kooky, odd-looking mezzo-soprano redefined people's notions of beauty and showed that a female star could be a strong, liberated, unconventional woman, paving the way for the \"girl power\" generation of female vocalists.\r\nFrom \"funny girl\" to first female mega-star, discover her life-story from her birth in 1942 to 1983, when her fame was at its peak, and see how she became an icon who shaped and influenced generations of female performers while embodying the causes of women and gays.",

What lay behind her sunny, blond, natural, dream-girl image?",

Over one billion wild animals perished. But thanks to Bear’s heroism, hundreds of animals have been saved who would never have survived without his help.\r\n \r\nBear’s heroic life is a far cry from how he started out - a puppy in a rescue shelter diagnosed with OCD. But since being rescued, Bear has spent his life training to find endangered animals by scent. This is a story of courage in the face of fire, survival in the face of devastation and hope rising from the ashes.\r\n ",

Every stage of the monarch’s life cycle is experienced in vibrant close-up, from egg to caterpillar to adult, and set to the background of sea and forest, sun and wind. By the millions and millions, the intrepid monarchs journey thousands of miles -- something no other butterflies in the world do over such a vast area. Amazingly, this migration happens in our midst, unfolding in backyards, farms, meadows, and along the shoreline, wherever milkweed and wildflowers grow.\r\nThe Monarchs are in great peril. Although the butterfly’s spectacular migration evolved over millennia, the last decades of human activity have put this phenomenon in grave danger. Beauty on the Wing is a film for all ages, and was created for all to gain a deeper understanding of the symbiotic relationship between habitats, wildflowers, and pollinators, and the vital role they play in our interconnected ecosystems. Filmed in Gloucester, Massachusetts and the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserves at Estado de México and Michoacán, the film illuminates how two regions, separated by 3,000 miles, are ecologically interconnected.",

      "ProgramSummary": "\"Becoming Trauma Responsive\", explores the effects of trauma on learning, behavior, and developing relationships. Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the United States were strained to meet the social and emotional needs of students. Most school districts reported large increases in depression and general anxiety from students and educators. Unfortunately for individuals already affected by trauma, the elevated stress and uncertainty caused by the pandemic were felt even stronger. Our film documents the experiences of three different schools in Kansas and Missouri to see how each has adapted and changed to meet the social and emotional needs of their students and staff. We also interviewed trauma experts who have spent decades in the field of brain science, therapy, and counseling to learn how to teach kids resiliency despite hardships and traumatic events in their lives. Finally, we hear the story of Nathan Ross, a victim of one of one of the most high-profile cases of child abuse in Kansas City, MO and how he was able to channel his experiences to help others in foster care and adoption. His message to educators provides a unique look at what we can all do help kids especially when we don't know their background. ",

In this Best of series, Bobâ€™s charismatic Certified Teacher Trainer and YouTube phenom Nicholas Hankins, having studied these last paintings of Bobâ€™s for years, brings the beautiful, never-before-seen masterpieces to public television. \r\n\r\nNicholas remains ferociously loyal to Bobâ€™s world-famous painting technique and presents the unseen series in a way that would make Bob Ross incredibly proud.

      "ProgramSummary": "Narrated by Tamlyn Tomita, Betrayed: Surviving An American Concentration Camp tells the story of a group of Japanese Americans and their incarceration by the U.S. government purely on the basis of race. In the compelling voices of survivors of Minidoka, a concentration camp in the Idaho desert, the film explores the unconstitutional suspension of the civil rights of these Americans during WWII and the long-lasting impact of the incarceration on their community. Betrayed examines the incarceration of Japanese Americans in the Pacific Northwest in order to tell a universal story about unjust incarceration and the loss of civil rights.\r\n\r\nThe film also explores the long-term effects of the incarceration over decades, and the phenomenon of intergenerational trauma as it affects this group of Americans. Over 40 camp survivors and descendants bring an unparalleled immediacy and urgency to the story. Our interviewees include Satsuki Ina, a trauma therapist who was herself born in a concentration camp. Other key interviewees include the late Kay Sakai Nakao, one of the first Japanese Americans to be taken (at the age of 22), the poet Larry Matsuda, Paul Tomita, whose father went directly from camp to join the OSS, and many others. \r\n\r\nLastly, Betrayed looks at the rise of Japanese American activism in defense of the rights of others, and the relevance of this story today, both in the targeting of groups based on their religion or ethnicity and the actions of the U.S. government at our southern border.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the one-hour film, this project also includes an educational program crafted by expert curriculum writers. This will provide educators the resources necessary to bring the incarceration story into the classroom, with four engaging short films and insightful lesson plans, study guides, and activities. The aim is to give educators the tools to engage 6th-12th grade students in focused conversations about exclusion, identity, and equal justice. By providing these engaging resources to educators online, free of charge, we will remove many of the roadblocks that have prevented the incarceration story from being taught in schools and will enable a new generation to move forward with a greater understanding of the civil rights tragedies of our past.

      "ProgramSummary": "\r\nBeyoncé and Solange Knowles are the most successful pair of sisters in pop history – and they couldn't be more different…It takes a long time for Solange to step out of her sister's shadow musically. A double portrait of two unequal exceptional artists. Beyoncé and Solange Knowles couldn't be more different: One is arguably the biggest pop star of our time, the other puts her complex artistic aspirations above commercial success. While Beyoncé is systematically built up by her parents to become a megastar, her sister Solange has to fight with all her might for promotion and recognition from her family. It was not until late that she succeeded in stepping out of her sister's shadow as an independent artist and emancipating herself musically. The film goes on a search for traces in Houston, the hometown of the sisters. Together with companions and friends it sheds light on the lives and careers. As the frontwoman of Destiny's Child, a band managed by her father, Beyoncé began her stellar career in the late 1990s. After the group breaks up in 2006, Beyoncé launches her solo career with seven studio albums and 32 Grammys to date. Solange, on the other hand, begins her first steps into the limelight in the second row: first as a background dancer for Destiny's Child, later as a songwriter for her big sister. But she wants more. Her third solo album \"A Seat at the Table\" brings the longed-for liberation. The album is celebrated by critics, Solange wins her first Grammy. After 30 years in the shadow of her sister, she has won her place at the table.\r\nAdditional Info",

      "ProgramSummary": "In the mid-1950s, a little boy in Norfolk Virginia took a bus with his classmates to hear the Norfolk Symphony Orchestra. Born to a single mother on welfare, living in a housing project, Thomas Wilkins emerged from that concert hall changed forever. \"I had heard the Star Spangled Banner before,\" he says. \"But never in the voice of this thing called the orchestra.\" He went home that day and took out his little toy soldiers, but this time he set them up in the shape of an orchestra and he played the conductor. Wilkins grew up to become one of the few African-American conductors leading a major orchestra--the celebrated Omaha Symphony. He's also the principal guest conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra's youth and family concerts conductor--the first African-American in the BSO's 131-year history to hold a conducting position with the symphony. As Wilkins prepared for his last season in Omaha, COVID-19 silenced the orchestra and social unrest sparked important conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classical music world. When it appeared that the worst was over, Wilkins returned to the Omaha stage to a grateful audience underscoring Wilkins' belief that \"in the midst of this mess, music still flourishes and beauty gets to have the last word.\"",

      "ProgramSummary": "Bible Storyland is a documentary film about an LA-based art dealer named Harvey Jordan and his obsessive, decade-long search to uncover the fate of a Bible-themed amusement park designed to rival Disneyland.\r\nThe film plumbs the depths of the many facets of amusement theme parks, the magic of Disney, the power of bible movies and the allure of celebrity in our culture.\r\nBible Storyland was conceived in the 1950’s when Bible films such as The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur were enormously popular. At the same time Walt Disney introduced the “first interactive entertainment experience” — the theme park. Bible Storyland is a combination of these bible characters and stories and Disneyland! “Ride to Heaven” and “Dante’s Inferno” with Lucifer himself greeting tourists are amongst the amusement rides designed for the new park.\r\n“Brilliant!” thinks Harvey. How can this miss? But whose idea was it? And why wasn’t it ever built? And could Harvey take up the cause and build the park today?\r\nOver the course of the ensuing years, Harvey tracks every lead that comes his way, determined to discover who was really the heart and soul of this epic endeavor. Slowly but surely, Bible Storyland takes over Harvey’s life.\r\nCelebrities and visionaries, Harvey observes, have in a way bested death – they will live forever. He can’t help but think, in his own charmingly earnest way, that Bible Storyland was dropped in his lap, perhaps, to ensure his own immortality.\r\nBut this journey has many twists and turns and amusing characters along the way. And only a man obsessed would have the stamina for the trip. Will his wife Debi finally crack and leave Harvey? Will Harvey discover the mystery that thwarted Bible Storyland? Can Harvey perhaps resurrect the park himself or will the curse get him first? And who will pick up the pig poop?\r\nFilmmaker Stephanie Hubbard’s sense of fun propels the unusual story of Bible Storyland. The film is greatly enhanced by her use of amusing animation sequences inspired by those captivating theme park drawings. She also utilizes a series of black and white, noir-style comic book images to “re-enact” portions of Harvey’s tale. Dream sequences provide a window into Harvey’s psyche and this being both a Hollywood and Bible story, film clips from Cecile B. DeMille’s biggest Biblical epics appear for dramatic effect.\r\nThemes and context are provided by Hubbard’s decision to enlist university professors and a pop culture humorist to explore the influences of theme parks and Disneyland on America’s landscape. Prominent religious historians are also brought in to discuss the influx of “sword and sandal” films of the 1950’s as well as the state of religion during the post WWII period.\r\nAll these decisions raise the enjoyment level of the film and engage the viewer to the very end and the resolution of Harvey’s quest for meaning. It’s inspired filmmaking that would have not been nearly as enjoyable in the hands of a lesser filmmaker.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Although Umatilla has challenges, it has something other communities do not. It has Heidi Sipe. Heidi Sipe became superintendent of the Umatilla School District in 2007. She inherited a district with staggeringly low graduation rates and students marked by poverty, but to Heidi, being poor doesn't mean you aren't capable or can't learn. The students just needed opportunities to grow and stretch, so Heidi started a robotics team.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of her husband, Kyle, a middle school math teacher who had zero experience building robots, Heidi created the STEM Academy of Umatilla, a K-12 afterschool program, and a robotics team to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an intensive, six-week, international competition in which each high school team designs, funds, and builds an industrial-size robot to compete against other teams. In 2016 more than 3,000 teams competed. During that six weeks, each team member lives and breathes robotics. Hours not spent sleeping or in school are spent with the team. Heidi and Kyle co-coached the robotics team, spending countless hours recruiting students and mentoring them, designing and building robots, and traveling to tournaments, including the ultimate -- the international robotics championship.  \r\n\r\nThough the robotics team was an important catalyst for change, this story is not about robots. It's about\r\ninspiration and reality. In 2013, the first year Umatilla's Team Confidential competed, the team's robot caught on fire. They learned that other teams had professional mentors, corporate sponsorships, and hands-on help from local machine shops and businesses. Team Confidential, meanwhile, didn't have these advantages. The students had to be resourceful. They did it all themselves, even \r\nlearning to weld by watching YouTube videos. They embraced the chance to excel and were active participants in their learning. And they realized that while their chances of winning were slim, they could definitely compete, and they deserved to be there. This story, which follows the team through the 2016 robotics season, is about refusing to see barriers and instead, seeing possibility.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Celebrating the love of model railway-making in Britain, uniting the model railway community, bringing them out of their sheds and attics and blinking into the daylight where theyll be challenged to tackle engineering problems on a scale theyve never considered before. The logistical issues of building a world-record breaking model railway in the real world are considerable. Rain, steep gradients, power and finding or making enough track are just some of the challenges. But our experts are convinced that the collective expertise of Britains army of 100,000 train hobbyists will be more than up to this micro-Herculean task. While the army of hobbyists lay the tracks and their miniature steam trains start to wind their way through some of Britains most stunning scenery, we will weave in the stories of how Britain first built its great train lines. Everything our teams encounter has a parallel in the full-size history of train building. And at a scale of 1:43 the task of building an 80 mile layout in miniature is a bigger challenge than anything attempted by the Victorians. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Birthright follows Cuban American electro-funk musicians, Cristy Cuci Garcia and Tony Smurphio Laurencio on their first trip to Cuba. In desperate straits, sixty years prior, their parents had left the island as political exiles. In 2016, the dynamic Miami-based duo, known as Afrobeta, were invited back to perform in Havana. Less than an hour's flight from Miami but an entire world away, these first-generation Americans are forced to confront their identities and the differing opinions of their loved ones, and each other.\r\n\r\nIn Miami, opinions on Cuba are a major point of contention between generations. In January 1959, relations between Cuba and the United States permanently soured when Fidel Castro proclaimed himself as the leader of the Cuban Revolution and thereby the country. In Havanas heyday, it had been a booming playground for American investors and outlaws alike. Castros Cuba, however, wrenched power through the appropriation and subsequent nationalization of both real and commercial property. Families lost their homes and all their worldly possessions.\r\n\r\nThese changes ultimately resulted in a U.S. embargo that would come to define Cubas isolation from the U.S. market. Adrift, many Cubans created new lives and remade Miami into a new city. Families, like Cristy and Tonys, were forever separated by the Caribbean Sea. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama signed a treaty to renew normalized relations with\r\nCubas leadership. A cap in the feather of the remaining Castro brother, Raul Castro, the announcement caused American travelers to go wild. Cuba, once a forbidden fruit, became a\r\nfruit that could be tasted. Waves of American tourists flocked to the island to see a place that felt frozen in an era long gone.\r\n\r\nCelebrities like Jay-Z and Beyonce, Kanye West, and the Kardashians were recorded riding through the streets of Havana in vintage cars. High-fashion label Chanel did a fashion show on Cubas famed Malecon, and uber-electronic band Major Lazer held the island's largest concert in 50 years. In an instant, Cuban Americans who had identified as Cuban for their entire lives were questioning what they really knew about the island that they had never been to. For Americans of Cuban descent living in the United States, it was a painful yet tantalizing tie to their forlorn history. Still, there's an ardent community, with Miamis political and financial might behind them, who have refused to return to Cuba until the Communist regime ends. Watch as tensions rise when Cristy and Tony share their plans with their parents, relate with peers who are also curious to know where their own parents came from, and navigate the politics in search of personal connection.\r\n\r\nIn an intimate and heartfelt journey, Birthright travels with Afrobeta to the homes that their families left behind. Meeting old friends and new, these Gen Xers match tall tales to traditions\r\nand fables to fabric as they visit their familys familiar haunts to explore who they are, where  they come from, and what it means to feel Cuban.",

      "ProgramSummary": "\"Headed to Canton\" is often used synonymously when referring to an NFL player who will one day be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in Canton, Ohio. The museum celebrates the greatest players, coaches and contributors to the professional game.\r\n\r\nNow, more than 50 year later, heading to Canton has expanded to include collegiate football. In 2019, the Black College Football Hall of Fame was officially welcomed to the campus of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Along with it came a game and celebration of the historically Black college and university brand of football.\r\n\r\nPBS Western Reserve commissioned this new documentary to Waters Media and its producing partner, Fog City Media. It tells the story of the formation of Black college football, the contributions that players from historically Black colleges and universities have made to the NFL, the founding of its hall of fame and why the hall is in the unexpected location of Canton.",

Everest. Believed to be possesses by deomons because of their blindness, the children are feared by their parents, scorned by their villages and rejected by society. Rescued by a blind educator and adventuress, the students invite a famous blind mountain climber to visit their school and let him lead them higher than they have ever been before. The result is nothing anyone could have predicted.\r\nThe idea for the expedition came about after blind educator Sabriye Tenberken, who founded Braille Without Borders, the first and only school for the blind in Tibet, who wrote a letter to the world renowned blind mountaineer Erik Weihenmayer, upon hearing the news that he had summitted Mt. Everest in 2001. Sabriye had read Erik’s book TOUCH THE TOP OF THE WORLD to the students in the school, and was inspired to get in touch following the incredible news of his summit. ",

The sound they made wasn't always 'nice'. The Alberts guitar sound was like a throbbing V8 motor, the sound of the tough migrant suburbs that it emanated from. It was anti-authority, hard-living suburban young Australia at its most confident and exciting. The sound of working class good times. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "A man of his surroundings and culture, a man of his times, a vigorously collected and admired figure, the \"Blue Dog\" painter has a legacy that endures. \r\n\r\nGeorge Rodrigue, his story, his artistic contribution, his entire life, are a vivid part of the Louisiana landscape, and continue to be an important part of the art world in America and beyond. \r\n\r\nFrom his important cultural works, literally putting the Cajuns on the map, to his world-renowned Blue Dog catalogue, Rodrigue's work is full of life, a deep ethos, color, narrative, and joyous storytelling.  WLAE is on a new film journey telling this remarkable tale.\r\n\r\nHis life in the studio Ã¢â‚¬Å“down the bayou\", his study on the West Coast, his return home, and the explosion of fame across the globe, and parts in between, form an art journey for the ages. \r\n\r\nStruck with Polio as a young boy, inspired to paint, the canvas took George Rodrigue from New Iberia to Los Angeles, and from to Paris to Asia. He has been sought by major worldwide brands, politicians, and collectors too vast to count. Yet, he has ever-remained, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Cajun Man\". As an astoundingly prolific artist, his connections to people, abiding friendships, are the fabric of his storied journey.\r\n\r\nAn ambitious project, a bold and beautiful film, we sincerely hope you will join us on this journey. \r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Some of the most brutal, merciless, and chaotic fighting of World War II took part in the mountains of Italy. The battle for Italy lasted until the final days of World War II in Europe. \r\n\r\nEven as the Allies advanced right into the heart of Berlin in May of 1945, the savage fighting in the mountains of Italy continued. \r\n\r\nIt was a fight that began in 1943 with the invasion of Sicily and then the Italian mainland itself. The famed American 82nd Airborne Division was handed the early fighting in places along the Sicilian coast and later at the bloody beachhead known as Anzio, south of Rome. \r\n\r\nLater, the Allies' fight took them into the mountains of Italy, a defenderâ€™s dream. The Germans always used the high ground to their advantage, inflicting severe casualties on the Americans and British. \r\n\r\nThe fighting in the mountains was so severe that the famed American 10th Mountain Division, customarily found on skis, was called into the fight. \r\n\r\nOne of those soldiers in the 10th Mountain Division was Bob Dole, later a famed Senator from Kansas and Presidential candidate. Dole was severely wounded in the Italian mountains on Hill 913 outside of Castel dâ€™Aiano, and his scars from battle would shape the rest of his life in public service. \r\n\r\nMany soldiers were affected by their time fighting in Italy; the conditions and fighting there were that horrific. \r\n\r\nThis film is about those who were there and lived through one of World War IIâ€™s most desperate fights, including a young Lieutenant from Kansas who his unforgettable ordeal in Italy would shape. \r\n",

In a single, galvanizing instant, Dylan plugged an entire generation in, forever changing not only the way the music was made, but the way it was heard. By putting you in the audience for Dylan's Newport performances from 1963 through that pivotal set in 1965, the program captures Dylan's metamorphosis from the folk family's best-kept secret to rock's fiercely confrontational poet who would electrify an entire nation and become the voice of his generation.

      "ProgramSummary": "The soft-spoken, calming voice of Bob Ross still inspires audiences,\r\nshowing us that mistakes happen and are okay. His positivity and \"happy\r\nlittle accidents\" were the foundations of The Joy of Painting.\r\nFrom 1983 to 1988, Bob Ross filmed his iconic show, The Joy of Painting, in a makeshift studio in the L.L. Ball home near the campus of Ball State University. Now part of the Minnetrista campus, the former WIPB-TV studio space was recently refurbished, bringing together objects, paintings and other artifacts, to create a space for visitors to explore Bob's life and career, feel what it might have been like to be on set of his show, and try their hand at painting some happy little trees of their own. The restoration process began in 2019, and the exhibit opened to the public on October 29, 2020 - Bob's birthday. The Bob Ross Experience gives viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the research and creative work that went into bringing this experience to life, while also witnessing the impact that Bob continues to have on artists young and old.",

      "ProgramSummary": "As a love letter to Southern stories and the authors and poets who write them, \"Books By The River\" explores the inspiration, passion, and writing that it takes to create a Southern story.  \r\n\r\nThrough in-depth interviews with Southern Authors, from inside a coastal library on the banks of Beaufort River, Holly Jackson engages authors as they read from their books, tell humorous and heartwarming stories, share their love of reading, and elicit advice for aspiring writers. Join us as we explore Southern culture through the passion of a reader, and the process of a writer, all, as we sit by the river. \r\n\r\nSeason 1 of \"Books By The River\" takes a deeper look into what it takes to write Southern stories and offers a more personal approach. In this 10-part series, authors and book settings span the states of the American South and encompass multiple book genres such as literature, historical fiction, nature, non-fiction, cooking, Southern culture, mysteries and thrillers. Produced by Dr. Caroline E. Sawyer, associate professor of communication studies at University of South Carolina Beaufort (USCB) and includes USCB students as the production crew. \r\n\r\n",

Topics range from the fear some African immigrants have of African Americans based on media stereotypes, to misconceptions about contemporary life in Africa and discussions regarding a “black identity” that can include all Americans from the African diaspora. \r\nhttp://www.siff.net/festival-2014/bound-africans-versus-african-americans\r\nhttp://www.seattleglobalist.com/2014/06/06/africans-and-african-americans-struggle-to-relate-bound/26339",

      "ProgramSummary": "During the Vietnam War, American men had to carry their draft card at all times. When your time came to be called up, a refusal to participate would land you in prison. But a growing resistance begins when one man stands up and publicly burns his draft in protest against the war. By the war’s end, thousands will be imprisoned for refusing to fight. When the streets are flooded with protestors, and the courts are flooded with refusal cases, the draft is ended, paving the way to the end of a bloody, brutal war.\r\nThe Boys Who Said NO! features a roster of high-profile resisters, as well as the unsung heroes of the movement. We follow Martin Luther King Jr as he takes a dangerously unpopular stand against the Vietnam War, and watch him stand alongside Muhammad Ali after he refuses induction. Meanwhile, we follow the story of resistance founder David Harris, whose baby with folk diva and peace activist Joan Baez was born during his imprisonment - as well as hear from draft resistors whose names have been almost lost to history, but whose actions built a movement.\r\nThrough dynamic archival footage and compelling interviews, this film captures, for the first time, this youth-led movement of nonviolent civil disobedience which has inspired subsequent battles for justice. This is a story of young people choosing conscience over killing; made especially timely by contemporary nonviolent movements against the climate crisis, systemic racism, and contemporary conflicts.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Planned in secret for two years, this prison break was outrageously ingenious, involving psychological manipulation, cunning subterfuge and jungle-style survival.  Yet for 25 years it is a story that has remained largely untold.  Now the peace process and the intervening years have contributed to it being seen in some perspective.   The IRA's mass breakout from the Maze Prison in 1983 was the biggest escape in British penal history.  Even Sir James Hennessey, who conducted the British governments's inquiry into the event, likended it to Colditz, and said it was \"...a matter of some congratulation for the Republican movement (IRA).\"  It was also a slap in the face to Margaret Thatcher's Tory Government, which was engaged in an all out war with the IRA.",

The story of what happened after this accidental death– of how people without the legal protections of marriage can find themselves completely shut out and ostracized– is poignant, enraging and opens a window onto the issue of marriage equality like no speech or lecture ever will.\r\nOn May 7, 2012, the anniversary of Tom’s death, after a year of documenting his own grief, Shane decided to make a video tribute to his partner entitled “It Could Happen To You.” This film, posted on YouTube, received over 3.4 million views and has been translated into over 20 different languages. The impact of Shane’s YouTube video and the raw nerve it touched, tells us this is an important story that needs to be told.\r\nWith the incredible support from influential people like Brad and George Takei and Neil Patrick Harris, Bridegroom was successfully funded on July 19, 2012 by over 6,500 people on Kickstarter.com becoming the most funded documentary in the history of crowd funding, and released in the fall of 2013.",

The film asks pertinent questions about diversity and community, and seeks answers on what it takes to bridge the issues and ideas that divide us all.\r\n\r\nBy appreciating their hearts and engaging in common interests, we examine how these polarized groups develop a greater understanding and respect for each other. What they look like, where they live, or what their beliefs are, no longer matter. They put aside their old grievances, find common ground and are enriched by the experience.\r\n\r\nSharing Heartbeats: A Bridge Across Our Divides uncovers ways that we all can learn to bridge our divides.

In the late 1970s, New York State Department of Transportation demolished nine blocks of a commercial property and hundreds of residential residences to build the Hoosick Street Bridge in Troy, NY.  Today, the Hoosick Street Bridge is a monument to division. Through The Uniting Line project, local artist Jade Warrick installs murals throughout the bridge's surface area to transform and beautify the space.  Bridging the Divide explores whether art can help a community heal.   ",

      "ProgramSummary": "After World War II, humanity declared that genocide would never be allowed to happen\r\nagain. But â€œnever againâ€ has become â€œagain and again,â€ from Cambodia to Bosnia to Rwanda\r\nto China to Ukraine.Why? What makes people dehumanize one another? Why does it keep\r\nhappening? And what can we do to make â€œnever againâ€ a reality?\r\nThe Broken Promise, a feature-length documentary, explores the mechanics of genocide, the\r\nconditions that allow it to occur, and the ideas and institutions that stand against it. The\r\nfilm presents the raw, unflinching first-person stories told by the survivors of genocide and\r\nhow the trauma of genocide ripples through generations.\r\nWith insights from forward-thinking policymakers, scholars, and activists, it examines the\r\ncharacteristics of those who perpetrate itâ€”their self-serving goals, their destruction of\r\ndemocratic institutions, and their utter disregard for the slaughter that follows.\r\nThe challenge is clear - genocide is not a once-in-a-generation event humanity can witness,\r\nwring our collective hands over, and consign to the history books. It is a tool authoritarians\r\nwield all too easily - and big business is complicit in its use. The interplay of racism,\r\nauthoritarianism, and impunity is shown to be at the core of genocide.\r\nWhile The Broken Promise includes honest stories of human cruelty and suffering, they are\r\nalso stories of the human spiritâ€¦and inspiring stories of hope.",

      "ProgramSummary": "In the countryside of County Clare, Ireland is a place called The Burren; a mysterious place unlike anywhere else, with deep caves, a stony, rocky landscape and ancient dolmens, ring forts and castles. The two-part documentary series THE BURREN: HEART OF STONE narrated by Brendan Gleeson, unveils the secrets hidden in the stones of this dramatic wind swept countryside.\r\n\r\nEpisode One \"Symphony of Life\" moves through the natural cycles of the seasons, witnessing spectacular scenes from the natural world, discovering prehistoric Celtic rain-forests and exploring the formations of the rocks and underground caverns, the mysterious disappearing lakes and the wildlife that inhabits the wilds of the Burren. \r\n\r\nEpisode 2 \"Song of our Ancestors\" locates clues written in the stones, tombs, and underground caverns that populate the Burren, which help us to travel back in time to reveal fresh secrets of the human story. We discover what Ireland might have looked like when the first nomadic big-game hunters came here. We follow the three distinct populations that lived in Ireland in prehistoric times and unravel the secrets of this unique and mysterious landscape and those who lived on it. It asks if prehistoric farmers irreversibly altered this landscape and if modern Irish society is descended from those who first lived here over 10,000 years ago.\r\n",

In this 10-part series, authors and book settings span the states of the American South and encompass multiple book genres such as literature, historical fiction, nature, non-fiction, cooking, Southern culture, mysteries and thrillers.

Peter has a unique role, funded by UK broadcasters but requiring him to work closely with Buckingham Palace. The programme features footage of the Queen from Peter’s 1,800 assignments, and shows how his pictures from events like these are then beamed into millions of homes around the world.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Based on the acclaimed memoir One Train Later by rock guitarist Andy Summers, CAN'T STAND LOSING YOU: SURVIVING THE POLICE follows Summers' journey from his early days in the psychedelic '60s music scene, when he played with The Animals, to chance encounters with drummer Stewart Copeland and bassist Sting, which led to the formation of a punk trio, The Police. During The band's phenomenal rise and its dissolution at the height of their popularity in the mid-80s, Summers captured history with his candid photographs. Utilizing rare archival footage and insights from the guitarist's side of the stage, Can't Stand Losing You brings together past and present as the band members reunite, more than two decades later, for a global reunion tour in 2007. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.amctheatres.com/movies/can-t-stand-losing-you-surviving-the-police",

Flashing back to two months ago, Rachel is a cleaner working for an agency, and she often takes her son with her because she can’t afford childcare. Although the work is relentless and she’s struggling financially, Rachel often cleans beautiful places including opulent hotels. After cleaning a fancy suite at a hotel, she gets chatting with a man in a hoodie who’s looking after a stray cat. The cleaning company is then approached by a private client who has asked specifically for Rachel to help clean a large house in the countryside. Again, she brings Liam with her, whilst there they enjoy dreaming about living in such an amazing place. On one cleaning visit, the owner is at the house – he’s revealed to be the hoodie man and he strikes up a friendship with Rachel’s son Liam. Liam likes nature, and they discuss the ducks in the pond. But slowly, we become to be a bit suspicious, as in the house there is a boy’s bedroom that could be perfect for Liam, what does Elliot really want from his bespoke cleaner and her son? And how did things get so bad that Rachel has had to go on the run? Can Rachel get out of it all with herself and her son intact? \r\n \r\nCast: Kara Tointon (Mr. Selfridge, Eastenders), Allen Leech (Downtown Abbey, Bohemian Rhapsody), Sara Powell (Silent Witness, Unforgotten, Damned), Taj Atwal (Line of Duty, The Control Room, The Syndicate)\r\nWriters: Cameron McAllister (New Tricks, Primevil), Nessah Muthy (A Gentleman in Moscow, The Winter King) \r\nDirector: David Leon (Vera)",

      "ProgramSummary": "Liverpool’s world-famous Cavern Club has been described as the “Cradle of British Pop Music, the place where the Beatles musical identity was formed. The club has played a pivotal role in each and every period of popular music since it first opened its doors as a jazz venue in 1957. Undoubtedly, without the 292 gigs The Beatles played here between February 1961 and August 1963, the Cavern’s story would be a very different one. But they did play those 292 gigs and the Cavern was firmly on the world’s musical map.  This is the story of a Club whose fortunes have ebbed and flowed in tandem with that of the city of Liverpool itself, a Club that has embraced an ever – changing music scene, the highs and lows, the dramas, the battles, the heartache, but above all… the music.   The number of top-drawer artists to tread its fabled stage reads like a roll call of popular music.\r\nImpressively, after seven eventful decades, it survives and continues to thrive as a relevant, contemporary live music venue as well as a major tourist destination, a place of pilgrimage for Beatle fans and music fans alike.\r\nDiscover for yourself the evocative spirit of this legendary venue through the people who were there and those who continue to “hold the baby” for future generations. Presented by Paul McGann and with contributions from the likes of Sir Paul McCartney,\r\nThe Cavern Club – The Beat Goes On is the story of a club that remains the beating heart of Liverpool’s iconic music scene and quite rightly takes its position on the world’s stage.",

Through encounters with Irish musicians and his personal heritage, Hope discovers the close ties between the country's music and its history. \r\n\r\nThis music-fueled road trip through Ireland takes viewers to medieval Kilkenny, where Hope meets \"Queen of the Irish harp\" Siobhan Armstrong; to Galway, the capital of street music and home to fiddler Se%C3%A1n Smyth of the band Lunasa; and to Dublin, where Hopes premiere a piece by Irish composer Ina Boyle with the National Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nDaniel Hope was born in South Africa, where his great-grandfather, Danny McKenna, settled after leaving Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century. \"Ireland is a homeland I've never lived in,\" says Hope, who received an Irish passport as a child when his father, writer Christopher Hope, left South Africa following his resistance to the apartheid regime, moving his family to London. Together, father and son embark on the most affecting leg of the road trip, visiting Waterford to search for McKenna's last-known residence.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Changing Seas is a series that takes viewers on an exciting adventure to the heart of our liquid planet.\r\n\r\nThe oceans have long played an important role in people's lives. Currently, more than half of all Americans live within 50 miles of the coast, and that number is rising. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 percent of Americans will live along the country's shorelines. Coastal and marine waters support 28 million jobs and draw 189 million tourists a year.\r\n\r\nWhile the population's dependence on the oceans as a natural resource and a source for recreation continues to increase, the health of these large bodies of water is rapidly declining. Over-fishing, global climate change, pollution; these are only a few of the threats that the oceans are facing today. At the same time, the seas hold great promise for ongoing medical research, as an untapped source of alternate energy, and other benefits that scientists are just now beginning to discover.\r\n\r\nChanging Seas goes to sea with explorers and scientists as they uncover new information that could lead to scientific breakthroughs. This documentary series lets viewers experience first-hand how oceanographers and other experts study earth's last frontier, and it sheds light on how human activities are threatening ocean resources.",

This documentary series lets viewers experience first-hand how oceanographers and other experts study earth's last frontier, and it sheds light on how human activities are threatening ocean resources.\r\n\r\nEpisode descriptions:\r\n\r\n1301 - Recreational Shark Fishing: Collaborating for Conservation\r\nShore-based, catch and release shark fishing is a popular past time in Florida. But is it having a negative impact on sensitive shark populations? Scientists have teamed up with anglers to study the survival rates of the fish and conduct outreach on best practices.\r\n\r\n1302 - At the Water's Edge: The Salt Marsh\r\nAlong scenic coastlines in the South, waves of mesmerizing green and golden grass stretch to the horizon. This is the salt marsh - a part liquid, part solid landscape that is teeming with life. How do scientists study the salt marsh? And how resilient is it to climate change?\r\n\r\n1303 - Alvin: Pioneer of the Deep \r\nThe deep-sea submersible Alvin has brought explorers to extraordinary places for more than 50 years. Now, as Alvin is poised to continue its revolutionary scientific work, a new set of upgrades will take it deeper than ever before. \r\n\r\n1304 - Habitats: The Key to Florida's Fisheries\r\nTarpon and snook are two of Florida's most iconic game fish. Both species rely on mangrove creeks and ponds when they are juveniles. With half of the state's mangroves lost to development, scientists employ creative solutions to restore and reconnect some of these important habitats to secure the future of the fisheries.\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Shot during a quick tour of Ireland just weeks after (I Can t Get No) Satisfaction hit # 1 on the charts, The Rolling Stones Charlie is my Darling – Ireland 1965 is an intimate, behind-the-scenes diary of life on the road with the young Stones. It features the first professionally filmed concert performances of the band and documents the early frenzy of their fans and the riots the band s appearances inspired. The band is shown traveling through the Irish countryside by train; dashing from cabs to cramped, basement dressing rooms through screaming hordes of fans. Motel rooms host impromptu songwriting sessions and familiar classics are heard in their infancy as riff and lyric are united. Charlie is my Darling is the invaluable frame that captures the spark about to combust into The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.\r\nIncorporates the new 2012 version of the film as well as the director s cut and producer s cut, plus significant unseen additional performance and other footage shot in Dublin and Belfast in September of 1965.\r\n\r\nABKCO website",

      "ProgramSummary": "http://www.itv.com/presscentre/content/noel-clarke-reads-chasing-shadows\r\nChasing Shadows is a thrilling, new four-part drama, which focuses on the work of a missing persons field unit charged with tracking down serial killers who prey on impressionable and vulnerable people.\r\n\r\nReece Shearsmith (The Widower, Psychoville, The League of Gentleman) plays DS Sean Stone and his partner, Ruth Hattersley is played by Alex Kingston (Doctor Who, ER, Upstairs Downstairs) while Noel Clarke (Star Trek Into Darkness, Doctor Who) takes on the role of DI Prior.\r\n \r\nOn the face of it Sean is intense, socially awkward and a misfit.  Get to know him and you realise he’s a man on a mission even if it leads him to self destruction and his eccentric manner frequently lands him in hot water. He’s obsessed with deciphering codes and uncovering patterns of behaviour particularly in relation to those most at risk, vulnerable missing persons.\r\n \r\nRuth, on the other hand, is a stabilising influence.  Maternal, but not mumsy, she’s an analyst from the Missing Persons Bureau tasked to work alongside Sean.  In effect his bosses have sidelined him and she is his lifeline.  Sean refuses to be tethered to Ruth, but eventually learns that he and Ruth make an awesome team. She has the ability to connect with people and has the expertise to trace missing persons. He is socially awkward and struggles to communicate; yet their strengths strike the perfect balance. On paper. In reality, it is a rocky partnership.\r\n\r\n#101  After criticizing police procedure in the aftermath of the eventual capture of a serial killer, DI Sean Stone is seconded to the Missing Persons Bureau, assigned to a new ‘unit’ with MPB analyst Ruth Hattersley. In reality, Sean’s new assignment is made with the intention of keeping him out of the way. But when Sean comes across the case of a missing 16 year old girl, Taylor, he’s soon back out in the field. \r\n\r\nIf he’s going to find Taylor before it’s too late, Sean has to use his unique pattern-reading intelligence to work out the killer’s method. But as more victims emerge, and Sean’s net closes in, he is faced with a startling discovery about the killer’s identity.. \r\n\r\n#102   \r\n\r\n#103 Sean homes in on a missing person who fits none of the five most common categories of missing people.  The only thing more interesting than a pattern to Sean, is someone who fits no pattern.  Stephen Eli - a lawyer and single father raising a teenage son - went missing without a trace a year ago. Looking into his last known movements, Sean spots a connection with two other deaths: both victims of an imprisoned serial killer, Leonard Vance. Sean believes Stephen Eli is Vance’s third victim. \r\n \r\nDespite police reluctance, Sean and Ruth travel to Crowley secure psychiatric hospital to interview Vance. He is a dangerous schizophrenic, destined to spend his life behind bars for two random, savage murders. Confronted with the evidence about Steven, Leonard eventually confesses to the murder. Sean is congratulated on cleaning up another case.  But when Vance is unable to lead them to the site where he buried Stephen Eli, Sean becomes uneasy.  Is Leonard telling the truth about killing Stephen Eli?\r\n \r\n#104\r\nSean starts looking into the murders of Leonard’s other victims. If Leonard is lying about killing Steven, maybe he’s lying about the other  murders as well? And if Leonard isn’t responsible for those deaths, then the real serial killer is still out there……",

      "ProgramSummary": "From 1907 until his death, John Peabody Harrington crisscrossed the U.S. chasing the voices of the last speakers of Native America's dying languages. Understanding languages was his gift, which became his obsession. From one tribal community to the next he went, working in collaboration with the last speakers documenting every finite detail of the language before it was lost forever. Writing note after note, page after page, day after day, year after year, until his death in 1961. Over time Harrington grew more and more paranoid fearing others would steal his work. This paranoia caused him to hide his work, only sharing small amounts to satisfy his employer the Bureau of American Ethnology. Shortly after his death, boxes of notes began arriving at the Smithsonian. Six tons of materials collected in a basement at the Smithsonian. Harrington had amassed well over one million pages of notes on over 100 different languages during his 50-year career. A feat matched by no other. Today descendants of those last speakers are now reviving their languages thanks to Harrington and the elders who trusted and spoke to him.\r\n\r\nI first was introduced to the story of John Peabody Harrington when I was doing master/apprentice language learning with my uncle.  During this time, I decided to not to go to graduate school and devote my time on learning my Quechan language.  This devotion involved doing research on archival materials related to my Quechan people.  I would spend hours and days searching through online articles and collections trying to locate and gather as much information about my people. In doing so, I came across a paper published on the creation story of the Quechan.  This paper was written by John P. Harrington in 1914.  I wasn't sure who he was, so I searched his name and surprised by the articles that came up.  I realized that this man had accomplished all this work on Native American languages, but no one has heard of him. It was as if he was purposefully left out of history.  \r\n\r\nI really felt that his story needed to come to light. The more I researched the more I began to realize just how massive his collection of notes impacted so many different Native American people. I became aware of just how large the problem of traditional language loss was in our Native communities.  I felt that his story could bring to light the issues and concern around language loss today.  Film is a powerful tool that can be used to tell stories about our people and to be used to help preserve our traditional ways.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first moved back to the reservation it was to work with our elders, documenting our language and sacred sites in order to preserve and pass this information down to the next generations.  In the process I've come to learn that there are so many stories about our people that will never be heard outside our own communities unless we tell them ourselves. Today, we have the means to do this. I hope my films will reach the larger general viewership in the hopes of bringing to light the history and current issues facing our people.  Most of the stories I produced I have a personal connection to, whether the story is about language, sacred sites, or history. I'm personal invested in these stories and the people who tell them, sharing with the world a small slice of my native experience. \r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "CHEERLEADERS: THE HIDDEN FACE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM\r\nThey’re icons of American culture and serious athletes in their own right. They form a veritable institution in the United States, entertaining tens of millions of Americans every weekend with their acrobatic displays that require years of training. Every year, the very best cheerleaders from across the country come together in Daytona Beach, Florida for the National Cheer Competition. In this documentary, we follow a team on their journey to the championship and examine the changing face of American cheerleading.\r\nFor many young Americans, being a cheerleader is not just a passion, but also an opportunity to secure a place in a great college. In the United States, where the average university tuition is 50,000€ per year, cheerleaders can win full scholarships. 16-year-old Gigi spends 30 hours a week in high school, and an additional 20 hours a week working at a restaurant. Then, three times a week, she travels six hours to attend a prestigious cheerleading academy. If she can win one of the coveted scholarships, all the sacrifices will be worth it.\r\nCheerleading is a sport where image is everything. “We have a specific way that they want us to do our hair and makeup for game day”, explains Carolina. She spends over an hour doing her hair and makeup. However, some teams are moving away from ultra-short, sexy costumes. Sammy’s team now cheers in jogging pants. “I feel more comfortable now. People look at me for my dancing and not for my body.”\r\nGigi, Camaryn, and their team train year-round for the prestigious competition held annually in Daytona, Florida. There, they will be judged on a short choreography and compete in front of 20,000 fans. As American cheerleading becomes more and more competitive, the demands and expectations placed on these young athletes continues to increase.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Dale Chihuly helped revolutionize the studio glass movement by expanding its original premise of the solitary artist to encompass the notion of collaborative teams and a division of labor within the creative process. For three decades, the artist has exhibited extensively in museums, and his site-specific, public sculptures can be seen in cities around the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the world-renowned artist reunited glass-blowers from important periods of his career for a week-long residency at the Museum of Glass in his hometown of Tacoma, Wash. The event brought together the artists and craftsmen to produce pieces revisiting some of ChihulyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important series, representing more than 30 years of work. Forty gaffers and artists participated in the residency, and were joined by more than 10,000 visitors wishing to see the creative process first-hand.\r\n\r\nThe fast-paced documentary, CHIHULY IN THE HOTSHOP (available in both 60- and 90-minute versions), captures highlights of the Museum of Glass residency, following Chihuly and his teams as they create magnificent pieces of glass art before an appreciative audience in the museum's state-of-the-art hotshop. Their work revisits 13 of Chihuly's best-known series: Cylinders, Baskets, Seaforms, Macchia, Soft Cylinders, Persians, Venetians, Piccolo Venetians, Putti, Ikebana, Niijima Floats, Pilchuck Stumps and Fiori.\r\n\r\nFilmed in high-definition video, CHIHULY IN THE HOTSHOP provides viewers with an intimate look at the challenging, often physically grueling, process involved in creating a work of art in glass. The documentary shows Chihuly drawing designs for the glass pieces as team members blow, roll, fire and shape the pieces to completion. From applying a thin layer of gold foil to a molten sphere of glass, to lining a mold with pieces of wood in order to impart a bark-like texture to the glass that will be blown inside it, the artists and gaffers use a variety of techniques to achieve the striking results for which Chihuly and his teams are known. The documentary reveals the wide range of artistic styles seen in ChihulyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, from the Navajo Blanket Cylinders produced with skilled glass-blower and gaffer Benjamin Moore, to the Putti series Ã¢â‚¬â€ small, cherub-like characters crafted from blown glass Ã¢â‚¬â€ created with glass sculptor Pino Signoretto.\r\n\r\nIn the film Chihuly discusses the genesis of each collection of works. He says he derived inspiration for his early, breakthrough Baskets series from Indian baskets he saw in 1977 at Tacoma's Washington State Historical Society. Chihuly recalls his creation of the Venetian series with Italian master glass-blower Lino Tagliapietra after seeing Art Deco glass in Venice; ultimately, the series \"took on a life of its own,\" drawing upon forms and techniques from throughout history. Chihuly also recounts how a visit to a Japanese island in the mid-1990s evoked boyhood memories of collecting fishing floats along the Washington coast; those memories spurred the creation of the Niijima Float series, the largest and most complicated and challenging pieces Chihuly and his team ever produced. Interwoven with these recollections and insights into the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work are high-energy montages of the artists and gaffers bringing ChihulyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designs to fruition.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Follow American artist Dale Chihuly as he tests his own resolve and challenges his team to push the glass medium to its physical limits in the pursuit of a new creative concept. Chihuly: Roll the Dice documents the master artistâ€™s exhaustive, five-year process to realize â€œRotoloâ€â€”a series of large-scale pedestal sculpturesâ€”and his working relationship with trusted long-time gaffer, James Mongrain. \r\n\r\nThe Italian word for coil, \"Rotolo\" is a series of large-scale sculptures twisting upward toward the sky. The â€œRotoloâ€ series started in 2013, when Dale Chihuly had the idea of working with clear glass coils.  James Mongrain, Chihulyâ€™s lead gaffer, remembers receiving a series of excited voice messages from Chihuly, where he outlined his new idea.  â€œIâ€™m thinking about these coils, maybe coming off a vessel, I donâ€™t know exactly what weâ€™ll do, I just know I want them to be big, as big as we can.â€  That began a four year exploration of technical and sculptural possibilities.\r\n\r\nChihuly is an artist known for the scale of his sculptures and his use of color. So it is notable that the â€œRotoloâ€ was initially made with clear glass.  The first experiments were as much about scale as anything else.  The first pieces were actually titled by their weight in pounds, as in â€œRotolo 121â€. Andreas BlÃ¼hm, director of the Groninger Museum, describes them as  â€œThe largest glass objects that you can physically makeâ€.  And for Chihuly it was about finding a form to best express this idea.  Andreas BlÃ¼hm continues: â€œThey are very heavy, but they look light.  The form is wild and baroque, but they are also quite reduced.  Awe inspiring, and subtle.â€\r\n\r\nChihuly ran into technical problems in working with glass of this scale.  The â€œRotoloâ€ changed radically over the four years, but maintained the spirit of the initial idea.  Chihuly made drawings as he went, exploring how many coils were necessary to convey the power of the glass, and Mongrain watched those drawings develop and worked to re-create them: â€œFor the last four years he did have this vision for how these pieces were going to look and were supposed to look, and he would do drawings.  Some were round and had a lot of coils, and some were just a fluid one or two.  I think weâ€™re at the point now where he wanted to be.â€",

A twisted tale of warmth until you burn! \r\nA journey as playful as it is evocative, CHILIHEADS takes us on the Hot Pepper road to five countries: Canada, the United States, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and India to meet ‘chiliheads’; lovers of hot peppers, to discover their culture and the sub-culture that surrounds the consumption of this unique spicy fruit. By engaging farmers, producers, chefs, scientists, historians and even psychoanalysts, the film deconstructs the incredible history of hot peppers and our crazy relationship to them. This formidable story then brings us back to our time, where small producers discretely wage a small war, to push the limits, in an attempt to win the title of “strongest pepper in the world”. ",

The series is filmed across the globe -- Season six features over a dozen countries, including Morocco, Italy, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Greece, Jordan and Colombia--and at the headquarters at 177 Milk Street in downtown Boston. Each episode gives viewers the chance to meet cooks from around the world and see how their inspiration results in faster, easier and bolder recipes. Travel to Fes, Morocco to make their famous flatbread, khobz; to Rome to unearth the original recipe for fettuccine alfredo; to Brazil to make white tablecloth pizzas; to Los Angeles to sample the rich diversity of regional taco offerings; to Yelapa, Mexico to taste corn, chocolate and coconut pies sold on the beach; to Jordan to learn how to make amazing falafel; and to Liberia to make a special banana bread. It may be a new way to use spices, a simpler way to cook chicken, a fresh combination of ingredients, or tricks and techniques that turn everyday food into something special. Where in the world will inspiration strike next? Join Milk Street Television on a culinary quest to transform the way America cooks--and eats.",

      "ProgramSummary": "From All3Media site:\r\n\r\nNewly declassified intelligence documents in Britain’s National Archives are unraveling an almost unbelievable story hidden for 70 years: that British officers armed, trained and provided the intelligence for Japan’s lightning Pacific victories of 1941-42. The attack on Pearl Harbor was carried out by Mitsubishi zero planes launched from aircraft carriers. Yet incredibly just 19 years earlier, Japan didn’t have a single one of these state-of-the-art warships: the first could only be completed with the help of an elite British design team and the first landing on its deck was made in a Mitsubihsi plane…flown by a British pilot.\r\nBritain and Japan had been allies throughout the First World War and some British officers were unwilling to break the bonds they had forged, even if it meant treason. The intelligence services were on to them almost as soon as they returned home from the Orient, only to be thwarted time and again by a government which feared a public trial of key members of its own establishment. This conspiracy reached its vortex just weeks before Pearl Harbor when MI5 presented the results of a secret surveillance operation to Winston Churchill. The Prime Minister wrote in a secret document secured for the film:\r\n‘At any moment we may be at war with Japan, and here are all these Englishmen, many of them respectable, two of whom I know personally, moving around collecting information and sending it to the Japanese. I cannot believe they have any idea of what their position would be on the moment of a Japanese declaration of war. Immediate internment would be the least of their troubles.’\r\nThe intercepted letters, transcribed phone taps, and even photographed Japanese pay cheques of the MI5 investigation have been hidden in the archives for 70 years…until now: it is this 18 year investigation that provides the natural narrative of this gripping story.\r\nA Brave New Media Production ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Winston Churchill understood the power of films, but the true extent of his use of cinema as a propaganda tool is rarely explored. In 1934, one of Britain's most celebrated film producers, Alexander Korda (The Private Life of Henry VIII;  The Third Man; The Four Feathers), signed Churchill up as a screenwriter and historical advisor. It was the start of a unique collaboration. Churchill provided script notes for Korda's productions and penned an epic screenplay. When war broke out, their collaboration took on national importance. Korda was sent on a mission to Hollywood to help bring America into the war, with positive results. \r\nUsing previously undiscovered documents, this film documentary examines that mission and a friendship that underpinned a unique, creative partnership.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Three-part biopic of the Liverpudlian songbird who would later find fame and fortune. It tells of her rocky road to fame and captures the essence of 1960s Liverpool. Championed by The Beatles, she began her career as a singer in 1963, and her singles \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" (1964) and \"You're My World\" (1964) both reached number one.   Starring Sheridan Smith (Mrs. Briggs; Gavin & Stacey), Aneurin Barnard (Spring Awakening; The White Queen), Ed Stoppard (Upstairs, Downstairs) and Tom Dunlea (Jimi: All Is by My Side) \r\n\r\nEpisode 1\r\nIn 1960s Liverpool, young Priscilla \"Cilla\" White is working as a typist, but frequently performs at Liverpool's famed Cavern Club where she meets young singer-songwriter Bobby Willis. Mersey Beat, a local music publication, prints an article on Cilla in which she is mistakenly referred to as \"Cilla Black\". However, young Cilla likes the sound of it and decides to use if for her stage name. It is arranged for her to audition for the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. However, her voice wavers mid-performance, and she loses ground to her rival, Beryl Marsden.\r\n\r\nEpisode 2 \r\nAs Cilla's confidence returns following her disastrous audition, Bobby urges her to give singing another go, and Brian Epstein gives Cilla another chance to audition by inviting her into the studio to record what would become her debut single, \"Love of the Loved\". The song fails to break the Top 30, but Brian then insists that Cilla change direction and take a gamble on a cover of a Dionne Warwick ballad entitled \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\". The gamble pays off and \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" shoots straight to the top of the charts.\r\n\r\nEpisode 3 \r\nCilla follows up Anyone Who Had a Heart with a second consecutive number one, \"You're My World\". However, she fails in her subsequent bid to conquer America and tempers flare in her blossoming relationship with Bobby. Meanwhile, Brian Epstein's life is unravelling as the Beatles start to drift apart and Epstein, a closeted homosexual, wrestles with his inner demons which include a dependency on sleeping pills. One evening, Cilla and Bobby are out enjoying a meal when Bobby takes a phone call and tells Cilla that Brian has been found dead. By his bed, the police found a contract from the BBC for Cilla to star in her own TV series, which she signs.",

      "ProgramSummary": "\"33 and Me\" is an arts and culture focused travel series that explores each nation through a look at the country's past, present and future of cinema.\r\n\r\n\"33 and Me\" takes audiences on a journey around the world through the eyes and experiences of 33 year-old filmmakers from a diverse set of backgrounds.  Each episode features an inspiring individual making films against all odds.\r\n\r\nWe present timeless and universal stories centered around human emotions, relatable struggles, and the inspiring journeys through life while overcoming its many obstacles.  For the filmmakers we feature, some of these obstacles include censorship on freedom of expression, gender inequalities, lack of funding, lack of electricity and lack of distribution options.\r\n\r\nEach episode has its own unique look and feel due to the vast diversity of landscapes and locales that we visit, such as the ancient history of the Silk Road in Uzbekistan, the colorful markets of Ghana, the hidden souks of Saudi Arabia, the fjords of Iceland during the Winter Solstice and the rhythmic nightlife of Cali, Colombia.\r\n\r\nEvery episode features an established or up-and-coming, approximately 33-year-old professional film director from that country and delves into the individual's hopes, dreams, desires and obstacles they face as thirty-somethings on their own home turf.\r\n\r\nWe integrate into the day-to-day lives of the filmmakers and visit their homes, neighborhoods, work places, hang-outs, and the locations that inspire their creative sensibilities.  We meet their friends and family, and see the current issues in their lives and societies.\r\n\r\nWhere do they find their creative voice and what propels them forward as filmmakers?  How does cinema reflect the culture they live in?  What stories are they compelled to tell through their movies?\r\n\r\nThe \"33 and Me\" team has chosen to cross borders and connect across cultures to create and foster positive experiences around the globe through cinema.  We truly believe that by doing so, not only enriches our individual lives, but also the experience touches the lives of everyone \"33 and Me\" comes into contact with:  the filmmakers, whom we feature and who's stories we share with the rest of the world; and the domestic and international audiences who will get to see these stories come to life on screen.\r\n\r\nSeason 1 Episodes:\r\n\r\nEpisode 1:  Turkiye  (woman protagonist)\r\nEpisode 2:  Ghana                           \r\nEpisode 3:  Bosnia and Herzegovina  (woman protagonist)                                                                                                         \r\nEpisode 4:  Iceland                              \r\nEpisode 5:  Uzbekistan  (woman protagonist)                                                                                            \r\nEpisode 6:  Cuba\r\nEpisode 7:  Romania \r\nEpisode 8:  South Africa  (woman protagonist)\r\nEpisode 9:  Brazil  (woman protagonist)\r\nEpisode 10:  Mexico\r\nEpisode 11:  Cambodia  (woman protagonist)                                                                              \r\nEpisode 12:  Egypt \r\nEpisode 13:  Bolivia\r\n1x60: Bosnia-Herzegovina",

      "ProgramSummary": "In summer 2020 the music stopped, as the pandemic put an end to most live performances. At Incline Village, Nevada, the annual Classical Tahoe summer music festival was dealing with that while facing a more personal crisis.  The loss of Founding Artistic Director Joel Revzen to COVID-19 devastated the Classical Tahoe family, but it also inspired a determination to find a way to make live music happen again in Joel's honor.  A combination of innovative thinking and personal inspiration resulted in a unique musical experience.  \r\n\r\nClassical Tahoe found a way to not only hold a three week Chamber Music festival, but do it safely and share it with a worldwide audience.  The six-episode series CLASSICAL TAHOE features select performances from the festival and supplements it with stories from the world-class musicians who perform and the team that was able to make this festival happen under the most trying circumstances.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The 2021 season was a return to normal for the event after the extreme measures needed to hold the previous year's festival during the beginning of the pandemic.  More musicians were able to perform this year, with a brand-new stage built expressly for the purpose of featuring the orchestra's sound while displaying the surrounding natural landscape. PBS Reno live streamed and recorded concerts during the 10th Classical Tahoe Chamber Music Series in July and August 2021, from the breathtaking outdoor setting of Sierra Nevada University in Incline Village, Nevada. The PBS Reno production and technology teams utilized multiple cameras to capture a variety of angles of the musicians, the instruments, and the audience.  Performances feature familiar composers such as Strauss, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven, with more modern additions such as Aaron Copland, Jessie Montgomery and Dave Brubeck.  The final episode of this season highlights Brubeck at 100, with performance that blends the Classical Tahoe Orchestra with the Brubeck Brothers Quartet.  It's a musical fusion that is guaranteed to get toes tapping.  \r\n",

The beautiful setting and dynamic staging are back, but some of the faces are new. Conductors Ken-David Masur and Jonathan Darlington make their debuts at the festival, and soloists Aldo Lopez-Gavilan (piano) and Tessa Lark (violin) light up the stage, as does special guest Isabel Leonard. The PBS Reno production and technology teams utilized human operated and robotic cameras to capture new perspectives of the performers.

      "ProgramSummary": "The Democracy Festival: \r\n\r\nAmid the intense polarization leading up to Novemberâ€™s elections, we proudly present â€˜Common Ground October,â€™ a PBS celebration of America's democracy â€“ honoring its storied past, examining its complex present, and envisioning a hopeful future.\r\n\r\nThis month-long festival features four hour-long episodes showcasing our â€˜better angels,â€™ voices from across the political spectrum who offer reassuring perspectives on how America has weathered such storms before and can again prevail.\r\n\r\nEach episode, centered on panel discussions, explores different facets of American democracy, emphasizing how each of us can help rebuild and strengthen our democracyâ€™s battered guardrails. \r\n\r\nEpisode Descriptions:\r\n\r\n1 - Saving the Shining City on the Hill\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviet Union dissolved, the triumph of liberal democracy seemed so assured that some political scientists famously dubbed it â€œthe end of history.â€ Yet, three decades later, history marches on while many of our political institutions have remained moored in place, creating a disjuncture that threatens the future of democracy. In this episode of Common Ground with Jane Whitney, we feature a panel of preeminent thinkers who discuss the battle between autocracy and democracy, analyze the evolving landscape, and offer strategies for Americans to safeguard our Republic.\r\n\r\nConfirmed Guests: Deval Patrick, Amanda Carpenter \r\n\r\n2 - The American Dream: A Dying Myth\r\n\r\nThe American dream, rooted in the belief that hard work leads to success, is the very soul of the nation, and perhaps the most widely shared expression of what the country represents. In recent decades, however, progress for many has stagnated while income and wealth inequality have surged. The data is irrefutable: With a backsliding labor movement, a growing housing crisis, flatlining wages, uneven wealth distribution, and stalled social mobility, the once-bright promise of the American Dream is fading. This episode of Common Ground with Jane Whitney explores the far-reaching consequences of these recent trends, examines the values guiding economic policy, uncovers the intricate ties between our political and economic crises, and charts a course toward making the seemingly impossible American Dream attainable for all who aspire to achieve it.\r\n\r\n3 - Our Better Angels: The Thinkers Shaping the Future \r\n\r\nBesieged by an unprecedented convergence of crises, the atonal, discordant bickering that marks our every interaction as a country easily could be mistaken as our national anthem. Thatâ€™s eroding our trust in institutions, unraveling our democratic norms, and generating a collective anxiety as oppressive as putrid smoke. Despite the diminished stature of many political leaders, a few voices rise above the maddening cacophony, summoning our 'better angels.' In a series of one-on-one conversations, featuring influential thinkers who have studied how the country has weathered its toughest times, Common Ground with Jane Whitney offers the calming reassurance of historical perspective and a moral clarity that can inspire a broad cross-section of Americans.\r\n\r\n4 - Hope, Healing, and Humor: Chicken Soup for Americaâ€™s Soul\r\n\r\nIn an era marked by vicious partisan polarization, an unrelenting culture war, declining trust in institutions, and skyrocketing rates of loneliness and isolation, optimism and hope have become as rare and precious as multi-carat emeralds. The American spirit, once defined by its resilience and vigor, now seems overshadowed by despair. Yet, amidst this darkness, a few voices emerge, offering messages of hope, healing, and humor. This episode of Common Ground with Jane Whitney gathers insights from a diverse array of guestsâ€” bipartisan thought leaders from throughout the seasonâ€” who share their perspectives on how we can rekindle the optimism that Americans once celebrated as their birthright.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Fear and fury now define Americaâ€™s public square, normalizing conflict and provoking violence.\r\nâ€œDemocracies donâ€™t have to die at the end of a rifle,â€ President Biden said in summarizing the\r\nexistential threat. â€œThey can die when people are silent, when they fail to stand up.â€\r\nThe way we live, the rule of law, national and global security, the fate of the environment â€” all\r\ndepend on whether Americans reject the eraâ€™s defining animosity and alienation and learn to\r\nincorporate othersâ€™ experiences into their lives.\r\nâ€œCommon Ground with Jane Whitneyâ€ provides an unrivaled paradigm of how we can do that.\r\nOur storytelling delivers intellectually rigorous but accessible information about the headlines\r\nthat mark our lives, making the most fraught issues relatable to every family. And it inspires\r\nall of us to become part of the solution, creating a new collective to forge a better future for\r\nus all.\r\nAmerica has always been a nation that defines itself as more than the sum of its parts, nothing less than an idea that weaves competing priorities into a multi-ethnic tapestry\r\nstretching from coast to coast. In the wake of a polarizing election in which both sides rejected the otherâ€™s legitimacy, â€œCommon Ground with Jane Whitneyâ€ presents (Re)Uniting\r\nAmerica, an eight-part series on the forces pulling us apart and the pathways that might bring us together. The series is divided into two stand-alone but interlocking modules\r\nâ€“ the first four shows, grouped under the title â€œUnity,â€ focus on embracing our differences, the second four, â€œThe Future Is Now,â€ on the forces molding our tomorrows.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Amy Cheney Beach was born September 5, 1867 in Henniker, New Hampshire and became one of the most respected and accomplished American composers of her time.

A range of stories are told by a terrific array of characters, some well known like Joshua Bell, the artist Nick Cave, and the multi-Grammy winning octet Roomful of Teeth; others will be wonderful discoveries for the audience (as they were for us). The three episodes are loosely structured. The Dance introduces the audience to some fascinating polymaths who demonstrate the many ways art & science intersect. The Material World invites viewers into studios, ateliers, and labs where materials and material science transform the creative process. Everything New Is Old Again demonstrates the extent to which science and technology have informed art and music through the ages until today.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Cookâ€™s Country is dedicated to celebrating food and cooking in America. The show features the best regional home cooking in the country and relies on the same practical, no-nonsense food approach that has made Cookâ€™s Country magazine so successful. Cookâ€™s Country is where family-friendly recipes from every corner of the U.S. are presented for home cooks everywhere. \r\n\r\nIn season 17, hosts Bridget Lancaster, Julia Collin Davison, and Toni Tipton-Martin join test cooks Morgan Bolling, Carmen Dongo, Lawman Johnson, Christie Morrison, Ashley Moore, and Bryan Roof. They cook regional specialties from across the U.S. (North Carolina Barbecue Pork, Philadelphia Tomato Pie, Alabama Orange Rolls, and more), and share their recipes for classic American fare and weeknight workhorses (Hot-Honey Chicken, Asparagus Salad with Radishes, Slow-Roasted Medium-Rare Short Ribs, and Sausage Lasagna). \r\n\r\nJack Bishop shares his expansive ingredient knowledge with viewers, including the differences between beef steaks, types of radishes, and a tasting of Worcestershire sauce. Adam Ried shares our recommended equipment, including Grill Gloves, Rolling Pins, and Can Openers. \r\nBryan Roof travels across the country, from Seattle to Philadelphia, to learn from local cooks that have mastered regional favorites. These dishes are the inspiration for recipes such as Seattle Chicken Teriyaki; Fried Cheese Curds; and Quesabirria Tacos, which he adapts for the home cook.\r\n\r\nCookâ€™s Country Editor-in-Chief Toni Tipton-Martin will also educate viewers on the origins and regional context of recipes like Cream Cheese Kringle and Fried Catfish with Comeback Sauce, accompanied by archival photography and art.",

      "ProgramSummary": "A story about being 17 again...\r\nIn the summer of 1953, Garfield Weston put together a sponsorship to send 50 girls from rural communities across Canada to London. A cross-country train collected each girl beginning in the Yukon, and gradually made its way to the port of Montreal. There, they would board The Empress of France and dodge icebergs across a stormy Atlantic, finally reaching Liverpool. They would soon be standing in Oxford Street to witness the Coronation procession of Queen Elizabeth. The experience transformed them instantly and forever. They witnessed a princess becoming queenâ€”she would be their Queen. The elements of character they saw in herâ€”a young woman so close in age to themselves, taking on the weight of the Crown, becoming a monarchâ€”crystallised in them important elements of character, and shaped a way of being for them that has guided them in life. Now, they are helping each other learn how to die - but not before returning one last time where they have tea at Buckingham Palace and are astonished by a surprise visitor.\r\nWith appearances by Richard E. Grant and His Majesty King Charles III.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Veterinary Medical Association published a joint study in 2019 indicating that veterinarians were more likely to die by suicide compared with the general U.S. population. Female veterinarians were 3.5 times more likely and male veterinarians 2.1 times more likely to take their own lives than the average. \r\n\r\nMultiple stressors play a role and most of the stress arises from the daily demands of their work, which include euthanizing beloved pets, a ceaseless drive towards perfection, a poor work-life balance, and being cyber bullied and vilified by disgruntled pet owners who feel the doctors don't respond quickly enough to meet their expectations. \r\n\r\nAll these pressures lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, and depression among this group of professionals who have dedicated their hearts and lives to caring for vulnerable animals.

From the advent of Jazz to the Rock and Roll, that morphed through the '60s and '70s, we explore the likes of Ringo, Charlie Watts, Keith Moon, John Bonham and Ginger Baker as they drove their rhythms across the world and changed music forever.

From 1966 to 1968, Cream dominated the charts with hits like \"White Room,\" \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" and \"Badge,\" displaying a bluesy, masterful approach to the psychedelic rock of the day. On the same stage where they played their farewell concert together in 1968—London's Royal Albert Hall—Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, and Eric Clapton reunited in 2005 for the first Cream concert in 37 years. \r\n\r\nReleasing just four albums as a group, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, and Eric Clapton left an indelible mark on the worldwide music scene. From 1966 to 1968 with hits like \"White Room,\" \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" and \"Badge,\" Cream dominated the charts with a bluesy, masterful approach to the psychedelic rock of the late-1960s, selling 35 million records and inspiring virtually every new rock group of the era. Yet much to the disappointment of their fans, the group disbanded after only three years, playing their final concert together in 1968 at London's Royal Albert Hall to despairing cries of \"God save the Cream!\" It took 37 years, but in early May 2005, Royal Albert Hall was once again the scene for the group's much anticipated reunion, described by The Washington Times as \" a unique moment in music history. It was a long time coming, but worth the wait.\"",

      "ProgramSummary": "Directed by Sandy Oliveri and Tony Palmer\r\nIn CREAM: FAREWELL CONCERT, the influential rock supergroup says goodbye to their fans at the Royal Albert Hall in London, on November 26, 1968. When Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce joined forces to form Cream, the history of rock n roll was forever altered. With Clapton's monstrous blues riffs, Jack Bruce's soulful vocals and Baker's polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming, the band was an astonishing mix of styles that produced timeless classics like \"Sunshine of Your Love and \"White Room.\" Their live shows were legendary marathons of improvisation, with the group expanding and contracting their famous tunes depending on their mood. On this night they were celebratory, a combustible trio cementing their legacy.\r\n\r\nFeaturing candid interviews with all three members and sprinkled with charmingly inept narration that attempts to \"explain\" rock music to a middlebrow audience, CREAM: FAREWELL CONCERT immortalizes one unforgettable evening with true rock gods.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Creole pig, indigenous to Haiti, had been of signiï¬cant value for years up until its disappearance. A hardy, boisterous breed, it served as a commodity to peasant farmers who slaughtered it for food or sold it to pay for their childrenâ€™s schooling, for weddings, seeds for their crops, and even traditional vodou ceremonies. It also held symbolic value for Haitians, as the Haitian uprising of slaves that led to the revolution and the abolition of slavery hinges on a Vodou ceremony incorporating a sacriï¬ced Creole pig.\r\n\r\nThen, in the 1980s, a swine ï¬‚u crossed the Haitian-Dominican border and started to affect the breed. The ï¬‚u also threatened livestock in the United States. As a pre-emptive measure, the USAID in conjunction with the Haitian government proceeded to exterminate all Creole pigs from the island, leading to a crushing economic blow for an already impoverished country.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Creole Pig: Haitiâ€™s Great Lossâ€ provides a lens through which to better understand Haitiâ€™s rapid and devastating economic decline in part because of this operation, along with the failed attempt to repopulate Haiti with a similar breed of pig with the hopes to reestablish economic security in the countryâ€™s farming community. Interviews include farmers, anthropologists, educators, and political officials, who help analyze Haitiâ€™s politics and history to make better sense of the Creole pig extermination operation. The story explores the lives of country and city people in Haiti and examines the political and economic impact of this mass extinction such as the decline in school enrollment and attendance, and the rise of mass migration as Haitians began to ï¬‚ee to the United States, landing on the Florida shores.\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Crooked Stick:Songs in a Strange Land\r\n\r\n- An Intimate Concert Performance - \r\nModern Arrangements of 19th Century, African-American Spirituals That Continue to Inspire Hope and Build Community \r\n\r\nThe power and poignancy of 19th century slave spirituals evoke feelings of raw power, deep empathy, pathos and poetry. When modern musical virtuosos blend modern Latin, Jazz and African rhythms with these ancient hymns, the spirituals soar even higher, truly elevating emotions and inspiring audiences. Now in a new concert presentation, internationally acclaimed mezzo-soprano Marietta Simpson teams up with two-time Emmy Award winning composer/arranger Tyron Cooper to offer an intimate concert performance.\r\n\r\nCrooked Stick: Songs in a Strange Land is a one-hour concert event, recorded before a live audience, featuring celebrated vocalist Marietta Simpson.  Simpson recently completed tours with the New York Philharmonic, the Washington National Opera, Opera Philadelphia, Theatre du Capitole de Toulouse and Opera de Bordeau.  She currently serves as the Rudy Professor of Music (Voice) at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. \r\n\r\nCollaborating with Simpson to craft modern arrangements is Dr. Tyron Cooper, an Emmy Award winning composer/arranger and ethnomusicologist. Cooper is also the Director of the Archives of African American Music and Culture, headquartered at Indiana University.  \r\n\r\nThe project title references an old African-American maxim that celebrates those who could \"hit a straight lick with a crooked stick\" - or overcome remarkable difficulties to do remarkable things - in this case referencing those enslaved peoples in the United States during the 19th century who created a shared language of music, using ancient melodies to find hope and strength in difficult times. \r\n\r\nToday those same songs are still sparking \"remarkable things\" by motivating today's top musicians to blend modern rhythms with these old narratives in ways that uplift audiences and ignite the spirit.\r\n\r\n",

Profoundly aware and deeply ashamed of the lineage of hate heâ€™d once promoted, Tony had long- contemplated traveling to Auschwitz in the spirit of tshuvah - to bear witness to the inconceivable ravages of the Holocaust, and deepen his personal work against the rise of extremist politics.\r\n\r\nThis project documents his profoundly personal journey of atonement to Auschwitz/Birkenau - exploring the conditions that allowed for the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe; shedding a unique light upon how men get into, and out of, violent extremist groups; and serving as a cautionary tale for our time that underscores the dangers in allowing hate to be left unchecked.",

Award-winning travel writer and host Christine van Blokland takes viewers to some of the most intriguing cities in the world, asking the who, what, when, where, why and how of each location. \r\n\r\nIn Season 5, we explore Spain, Greece, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Norway. Viewers will experience the beauty of Barcelona and the curiosities of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia ... the greatness of Greece, from the Acropolis' temples to Athena to curious Crete, with its Minoan and Venetian ruins...and travel to Bergen for Norway's National Day, where children dress up in \"bunads\"... In Portugal, viewers learn about Lisbon, explore its castles, villages, language and culture. In Innsbruck and the Tyrol, we are immersed in all things strudel, the Habsburgs' palaces and quirky history,  and learn why there is a giant golden rooftop in the heart of a medieval city. Up in the Alps, we even learn how to make an igloo. In Sicily, we find out the origins of the alphabet, and why the color purple became linked to royalty at some Phoenician ruins. In Sardinia, we wander through some medieval streets of Cagliari, and find out why it was very, very important to be outside the gate and walls by sundown.",

When? & How?\r\nCurious Traveler takes viewers on an enriching and entertaining field trip for grown-ups to the world's most curious destinations. Award-winning host & writer Christine van Blokland explores little-known facts about each location; giving a new appreciation of old favorites. The result is a fun (and often funny) history lesson, wrapped in a beautifully filmed travel series. Season 7 includes destinations in Germany, France, AND the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nCurious Traveler, Season 7 takes viewers across Germany to explore the Benedictine Monastery of St. Mang in FÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ssen, and its stunning-in-pink library; the 12th century stone bridge and UNESCO World Heritage town of Regensburg; the SchÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶ner Brunnen of Nuremberg, full of symbols and mysteries; the Disney-esque walled city of Rothenburg-ob-der-Tauber; the soaring Neues Rathaus of Munich; and more. In Lyon, France, Christine explores the secret traboules, used by the French resistance, and climbs high above the city to FourviÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨re Hill, to visit its basilica and city foundations. In Utrecht, Netherlands, Christine goes underneath the Dom Tower, to explore 2000 years of Dutch history, then back up and out to visit the largest castle in the Netherlands, de Haar Castle, and then wraps up the visit with the quintissential Dutch experience: a canal tour of this historic city.

Focusing on the Spencer family story we discover how Diana’s childhood impacted her – from her Mother’s tragic loss of a first son and the devastating custody trial that followed her parents’ bitter divorce, to the arrival of the flamboyant Step-Mother who Diana hated and the death of her beloved Father which gave her a new perspective.  \r\n \r\nCombining powerful insights from those that knew the Princess and her family personally, with drama reconstruction of some of the defining moments of her parents’ relationship, we trace the striking parallels between their love story and Diana’s own. And reveal how the events of Diana’s past may have influenced the decisions of her Royal future.  This is a story of broken first love, infidelity and heart-breaking family betrayal played out in the glare of the media spotlight. which gives a fascinating glimpse into the woman before the Royal legend and a dynasty whose story has all the twists and turns of a Hollywood blockbuster. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Narrated by actor Kevin Bacon.\r\n\r\nThis film is focused on two Top Secret WWII organizations - American and British organizations responsible for silent, unseen, highly classified missions of critical importance to defeating the Nazis. Soon after War II, the OSS became the CIA, founded in July 1947, becoming the foundation of our current Intelligence network. The British SOE during WWII (Special Operations Executive) is now MI6, continuing its long history of intelligence services.\r\n\r\nClassified Top Secret by the American OSS and Most, Most Secret by Britainâ€™s SOE, the few remaining records were partially declassified in 1998.  \r\n\r\nThe actions of these two organizations - their operations and missions and the women and men who volunteered to be secret agents, each likely not to survive, and their collective courage, risks, failures, and successes continue to be learned and always astound.\r\n\r\nWho were these women and men, our secret agents of World War II? What were their sacrifices and impacts on World War II?   Much of the current public perception of OSS/SOE, even now, is based upon utterly fictional events, enhanced or blended films of fantasy, produced after WWII with at best a loose association to facts including classics like The Guns of Navarone, the Bridge On the River Kawai, Where Eagles Dare, Inglorious Bastards â€“ and many others, and obviously all the James Bond series.\r\n\r\nMy Father's Secret War: France 1944 is a riveting and true story of an American who joined the British S.O.E. and was parachuted into France with a small team just after D-Day to organize the French Resistance into a cohesive army. \r\n\r\nThe mission was to stop Germany's most feared troops from reaching Normandy and affecting the D-Day landings of June 6, 1944.\r\n",

Emery, (p.g.a) traces the history of racism in American healthcare, beginning with the brutal medical experimentation that slaves were forced to undergo. As this story unfolds over our nation’s history, the very same inequalities and biases continue to plague our healthcare system, creating disparities in the quality of care that Black and Brown people are afforded. Interwoven with the testimonies of experts and medical practitioners are the personal stories of patients who have been victimized by healthcare inequities, including the filmmaker’s own experiences as a quadriplegic African American woman. The COVID-19 pandemic is an exclamation point calling attention to these existing disparities, as we have witnessed communities of color experience disproportionately high rates of infection, staggering losses of life, and increased economic hardship.",

      "ProgramSummary": "When Natalie Varga stands accused of murdering her husband in cold blood, disgraced investigative journalist James Alden finds himself captivated by the case.  The mystery of whether she committed the crime broadens into a darker, stranger narrative as our London setting shifts to Hungarian high society. It's a crime perfectly designed to cause a press feeding frenzy - the gruesome murder of businessman George Varga in his lavish Chelsea mansion. Varga’s British wife Natalie is chief suspect, and no-one believes her alibi who is also an ex-lover. Natalie is from a tough background and has reinvented herself - neither press nor public can decide if she's remote or shy. Is she a super intelligent manipulator or a resourceful young woman, the victim of circumstance?  Her South London family have criminal connections which come back to haunt her and upend her new life. James used to be an award-winning investigative journalist years ago but his confidence was destroyed by the case he screwed up which allowed a killer to go free. Natalie sees in him the journalist he used to be and offers him redemption: the exclusive interview everyone wants if he finds out who really killed her husband. In the tradition of classic noir a key character returns from the dead and becomes pivotal to the mystery.  James is pushed to breaking point by his obsession with the woman he's trying to exonerate and until the very end we don't know whether he's right to believe her.  With the court of public opinion ruling Natalie guilty until proven innocent, can James separate the truth from the fiction?   \r\n\r\nStarring: Charlie Murphy (Halo, Peaky Blinders, Happy Valley, Damages) as Natalie Varga, and James D’Arcy (Red Election, Agent Carter, Broadchurch) as James Alden.

      "ProgramSummary": "The Worldâ€™s Toughest Row. An extreme race where unassisted rowing boats cross the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary Islands to Antigua. For our team of four veterans, it was the ultimate test of body and mind, and an opportunity to raise funds and awareness for other vets suffering with mental illness. \r\nThe journey was incredible. The team trained hard and felt prepared for the grueling physical and mental beating the race would offer. But nothing could have prepared them for the sudden, unrelenting, and raging storm that sent a 30-foot swell with a 50  knot wind gust that violently capsized their boat. \r\nThe boat was designed to right itself, but it did not. Now upside down, two men were trapped in the small sleeping cabins below the deck, and two were in the ocean. Struggling against time and the raging sea, everyone worked ferociously to get into the life raft. \r\nThe life raft was deployed but suffered a gash, and patch kits made of unusable materials did not help. The waves and the wind continued to pound the small life raft. There were 18 hours to rescueâ€”the maximum time the life raft could exist in the ocean. \r\nCommunication devices were lost, wet and on slowly fading batteries. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday got no response. Then some static. An atmospheric miracle got their signal to a giant freighter. Commanded by a first -time captain, the 590 ft long freighter skillfully maneuvered alongside the 5-foot life raft as their time was running out. \r\nInjured and exhausted, the team now had to climb a rope ladder three stories into a heaving ship. The waves and wind were fighting their efforts and as the last man took hold of the ladder, the life raft disappeared into an angry ocean. \r\nThis is their story. Four veterans who never gave up, who despite incredible odds, continued to hope, continued to support each other, and were rescued. They began this journey to encourage other veterans to share their stories in the hope of healing. Now they have the ultimate story to share.\r\n",

As one of the country's leading practitioners of contemporary classical design, his work has received multiple awards, and has been featured in Architectural Digest, Town & Country, Veranda, and The New York Times. \r\n\r\nIn this portrayal of a master at the height of his craft, Gil examines how he draws upon the power of memory to create extraordinary homes, and reflects on the spaces that have shaped his sensibilities as an architect. He leads viewers through three spaces that exemplify his work: his firmâ€™s renovated design studio in Manhattan, a Hudson Valley home inspired by English estates, and a summer house on the shores of Lake Champlain. Influenced by the elegance and charm of classical American architecture, and also adept at accommodating a modern lifestyle in his designs, he reveals his design process and the particular qualities that define an unforgettable place.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Devil's Instrument explores the history, lore, craft and haunting music of the Hardanger fiddle and the dances that accompany it as they are practiced in present day Norway.\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Instrument was the name given to the fiddle by religious leaders in the 19th century who thought there was no place in the church for such an instrument since it was used for weddings, dances and gatherings where alcohol and merriment ensued. The documentary interviews woodworkers who make the fiddle, the musicians who play it and the dancers who spin to it against the backdrop of the gorgeous Norwegian landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Hardanger fiddle is a traditional stringed instrument from Norway. It is similar to the violin, though it has eight strings (rather than four as on a standard violin) and thinner wood. Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin, while the rest, known as sympathetic strings, resonate as drone strings.  The instrument is often highly decorated with extensive mother of pearl inlay on the fingerboard and black ink decorations on the body of the instrument. \r\n\r\nThe Devil's Instrument is a new documentary by Pioneer PBS of Granite Falls, Minnesota. It is produced by Dana Conroy with videography by Ben Dempcy and Kristofor Gieske and edited by Kevin Russell.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Episode 1 America, Land of The Free?\r\nEpisode 1 asks the question What is democracy?  The introduction includes a short history lesson of the birth of democracy and America's own unique democracy. The episode takes a look at some uniquely American challenges that limit American democracy such as hyper- partisanship, negative partisanship, institutional constraints such as gerrymandering, the Electoral College, voter registration, public apathy and cynicism, influence of money in politics, and the public's media consumption habits.\r\nThe interviews provide answers to many questions. Does it really matter if American democracy is getting weaker? What does it look like when democracy fails? How close are we to the end of democracy in this country? How can American democracy fail? What are some possible outcomes for the end of democracy in America? Is The Handmaid's Tale so far fetched?\r\n\r\nEpisode 2 Democracy Around the World:\r\n\r\nEpisode 2 takes the viewer around the world to explore other democracies. Each of our problems established in episode 1 is projected onto other country examples adding an interesting perspective to our own democratic successes and weaknesses.  The series continues to make the viewer think about America without explicitly calling that out. The host introduces Freedom House that measures the freedom of countries around the world. They estimate that democracy as an institution has been in recession for the past 20 years.The episode ends with where America ranks relative to the rest of the world. And how even in the US freedom has declined.\r\n\r\nEpisode 3 The Way Forward:\r\nEpisode 3 begins by dissecting a theory by Neil Howe that history shows periods of great civic catastrophe and reconstruction every 80 to 90 years since the Middle Ages. The host leads the viewer through  the basics needed for a democratic society to thrive such as  Freedom of speech, free and fair elections and a focus on human rights. How has media and social media in the U.S. affected  our democracy?  Does a 2 party system still work today?  Does the electoral college still work? How does a pandemic become a partisan issue?  What is the answer to strengthening our democracy?  Start early by teaching our children civics and promote more civic participation. The future of our democracy is in your hands.   Democracy is only as strong as our collective participation so let's do this!",

      "ProgramSummary": "American Public Television Exchange released our previous film, Divided We Fall: Unity Without Tragedy in May 2020, after 140 stations voted to select it for use.  In May of 2023 we extended APTâ€™s license to contract DWF for an additional two years.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the success of DWF we have created a new complimentary companion film that stations may want to broadcast in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe first film told the story of how two groups of a dozen strangers divided over then President Trump came to listen to each other with curiosity, see each otherâ€™s humanity and form bonds across our political divides.\r\n\r\nListening With Curiosity shows how those bonds have remained.  It centers the story on eight of the original cast members - equally divided red/blue - who came to Colorado for a live screening with an audience talk back on April 1, 2022.\r\n\r\nOur new film is perfectly timed to address the likely divisive mood in the country in 2024.   It shows it is possible for ordinary Americans to bridge divides in a manner that strengthens our democracy.    It explains we created an experiment  in 2018/19  to see if it was possible and succeeded.   Our new film shows the results - i.e. the bonds created and divides crossed - have remained.\r\n\r\nViewers will see for themselves and learn how our participants genuinely found trust in each other that allowed them to bridge their political divides.   To reinforce with the viewer the authenticity of this experience we include three experts in the field of conflict resolution discussing the hope they see in our experiment - Dr. Peter Coleman founder of the Global Conflict Center at Columbia University,  Dr. Samantha Moore Berg past Director of the Peace and Conflict NeuroCenter at U of Penn and Stephen Hawkins North American Director of More in Common.\r\n\r\nWe have two additional partners in creating this film.  Living Room Conversation which provided some of the funding and will, once released, work with PBS Member Stations and public libraries to use both films to create bridging conversations in their communities.\r\n\r\nThe second is the new Institute for Public Service at MSU Denver.   MSU Denver has the largest and most diverse student body in Colorado.  SIxty-five percent of their students are first generation college students.   Two Institute students - Josie Lavender and Greg Gonzales - who have been part of creating and broadcasting the Solution Studio at MSU Denver have worked with Tom Cosgrove to produce and edit this film.   The Institute is planning on organizing a Strengthening Democracy Week in Denver when RMPBS is able to premier it in late February.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rocky Mountain Public Media / RMPBS as part of our mission of â€œto create a Colorado where everyone is seen and heardâ€ is dedicating ourselves to the theme of strengthening our democracy 2024-- making Listening With Curiosity a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nDiane Cerafici and Brad Haug \r\nRocky Mountain Public Media\r\n\r\nTom Cosgrove\r\nNew Voice Strategies",

      "ProgramSummary": "Untamed wilderness surrounds the distinctive rock towers, stroked by the golden glimmer of sunset: this gorgeous scene could only be in the Dolomites. It's a place for myths and fairy tales, and there's no shortage of them here. But among the crags and hidden in the shady creeks, wildlife creates new stories and fables day by day. Take the lonesome wolf that roamed up from the Appenines in search of a mate - and finds her here. Or the red fox we find carelessly at ease in every habitat: forest, bare rock, meadows, abandoned huts, even snow and ice; few animals are so adaptable. And among the rocks is a more specialized and even more skillful climber - the chamois. Contemplating the Dolomites' wildlife seems to give this region a new shape, a new spirit - and helps us understand some of the region's immortal legends. \r\n\r\nhttp://contentsales.orf.at/show_content.php?hid=14&sid=75&filter=364&sub_filter=0&mpi_id=537050",

      "ProgramSummary": "     In its continuing exploration of New Orleans' culinary traditions, WYES is producing a new 26-part cooking series showcasing Dooky Chase, the Treme restaurant and local landmark where Chef Leah Chase became known as the Queen of Creole Cuisine \r\n    The series is shot on location in the Dooky Chase kitchen with dishes prepared by younger generations of the Chase family who have led the restaurant since Leah's death in 2019. In themed episodes that trace the history of the restaurant and its founders, viewers will meet Leah's grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase IV, who now oversees the restaurant's kitchen; her niece Cleo Robinson, who joined Leah in the kitchen in 1980; and the restaurant's newest chef, Leah's great-granddaughter Zoe Chase. Paired with some of the menus are specialty cocktails crafted by Leah's granddaughter Eve Marie Haydel, who has updated drink recipes from the restaurant's earlier days.\r\n     Some recipes will reflect Leah's early years in the small town of Madisonville, Louisiana, on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Others will return to the humble beginnings of the Orleans Avenue restaurant her in-laws started as a po-boy sandwich shop in 1941, before Leah and her husband Edgar \"Dooky\" Chase Jr. developed it into one of the country's first fine-dining establishments for African Americans during segregation. \r\n     Each program in the series will explore a different chapter of the restaurant's history. On an episode about distinguished guests, the Chase chefs will share a recipe for Grits and Quail that Leah served at the restaurant in 2008 to President George W. Bush during a North America Leaders Summit. On another episode the restaurant's significant place in the history of the Civil Rights Movement will be celebrated with preparation of Creole Gumbo, a dish Leah served to Martin Luther King Jr. and other social activists when they held strategy sessions in an upstairs dining room. Today Dooky Chase remains a crossroads of culture and community, where gumbo is still a favorite of customers from all walks of life. To commemorate the important role Dooky Chase played in the national Civil Rights Movement in the 1950's and 1960's, an interpretive marker has been placed outside the restaurant honoring it as a stop on the Louisiana Civil Rights Trail. \r\n     The series will also demonstrate a new take on Creole classics being introduced at the restaurant. Dishes like Lamb Chops with Mint Glaze and Fish Cakes with Citrus Beurre Blanc reflect the professional training of Chef Dook, who has a diploma from the Cordon Bleu in Paris, and Chef Zoe, who is a graduate of the New Orleans Culinary and Hospitality Institute (NOCHI). \r\n     The new WYES series will share Leah's legend through interviews with her son Edgar Chase III, daughter Stella Chase Reese and other family members. Archival video and new footage shot during Mardi Gras, Holy Thursday, and other special occasions at the restaurant will link past and present. \r\n     Leah continues to inspire people through food that is now prepared by those who carry on her unwavering commitment to the people of New Orleans. Dook Chase speaks for the family when he says, \"My grandmother's motto that she lived by was pray, work and do for others.That was a seed planted into us and what we continue to live by.\"\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Producers Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation have created the first five half-hour episodes of a new geology series for a public television audience.  Hosted on camera by independent filmmaker-geologist Doug Prose, Doug's Geology Journal focuses on a science topic that is rare on PBS but has gotten high marks for audience appeal.  Host Doug Prose is a geologist by training; his solid footing internationally in the world of geology ensures that the program's content is up-to-date and scientifically accurate.  Doug is also an accessible personality with long experience in making films for broadcast on PBS.  His on-camera presence is informal, engaging, lighthearted and humorous.  In the series he appears on camera exploring the geologic terrain on foot or in a vehicle, hiking, climbing, running, squeezing between rocks, and even sitting in the pool of a hot spring, while sharing insights that make sense of complicated geologic stories.  His observations emphasize big-picture geologic processes that shape the landscape, fascinating but not well-known.  To illustrate important points he makes an occasional rough pencil sketch in his journal.",

      "ProgramSummary": "An immigrant story of survival, A DREAM IN DOUBT focuses on Sikh Americans living in Phoenix, Arizona, a close-knit community of families who experienced a wave of frightening hate crimes in the aftermath of 9/11. Rana Singh Sodhi, a thirty-six-year-old Indian immigrant, finds his life forever altered by the 9/11 terror attacks, not because he knew someone who died in the rubble, but because his turban and beard became symbols of the terrorists who attacked America. Rana's eldest brother, Balbir --who also wore a turban and beard--was America's first post-9/11 hate crime murder victim, gunned down at his gas station by a man who claimed he was rooting out a terrorist.\r\n\r\nAs if one murder was not enough, Rana's next eldest brother, Sukhpal, was shot and killed in mysterious circumstances less than a year later. The events captured in A DREAM  IN DOUBT show the almost daily horrors the Sikh community live with as misunderstood Americans.  Yet Rana relies on his belief in the American values of freedom, self-reliance, equality, and protection of the weak--values which also mirror Sikh teachings--to carry him through injustices.  \r\n\r\nBy following Rana attempts to insure that justice is served in his brothers' murders, A DREAM IN DOUBT tells a uniquely personal story of tragedy, family connection, community, and an American Dream that is in danger of slipping away. In the end, this moving portrait of one man's odyssey from persecution in India to embracing America as his homeland proves that courage and hope have the power to overcome hate. \r\n\r\nThis program was previously included in the INDEPENDENT LENS series.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The hit travel series DREAM OF ITALY returns for a highly anticipated third season as host Kathy McCabe explores Italy with her trademark mix of authentic experiences with a dash of celebrity star power including this season's special guests tenor Andrea Bocelli, Academy Award-winning actress Marisa Tomei and 3-Michelin star chef Massimo Bottura. Italy and the Italian lifestyle have captivated Americans and they simply can't get enough of both!\r\n\r\nSeason 3 starts with pure magic during an intimate visit to the seaside home of famed Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in Tuscany. We learn how this mythical region has influenced not only Bocelli's life but his music, explore his deep faith and love of dogs and visit the places and people (family is everything to him) that made him who he is. Of course Bocelli performs for us...Welcome to Andrea Bocelli's Tuscany - a travel episode unlike any other!\r\n\r\nThe Black Madonna or Madonna Nera is especially revered in southern Italy where she has a divine and mysterious history. Black Madonna expert Alessandra Belloni and Academy Award-winning actress Marisa Tomei join us for this unique episode in the region that both Marisa's family and Kathy's family hail from. We even surprise Marisa with a visit to her ancestral hometown nearby. We attend two incredible celebrations for the Madonna complete with chanting, candles, fireworks, dancing and incredible acts of veneration. \r\n\r\nWhen we visited with 3-Michelin star chef Massimo Bottura in Modena, a town in the \"slow food, fast cars\" region of Emilia Romagna, we had no idea that we would have such adventures, it would become two very special episodes about the chef, who shot to fame on Netflix's \"Chef's Table\" and the unusual culinary empire he has built from the land of balsamic and Parmigiano Reggiano. He's also taken his cues from another Modena maestro, Luciano Pavarotti, in the way he fashions a menu after an opera. These two episodes are can't miss for foodies! \r\n\r\n\r\nDREAM OF ITALY loves to bring viewers to incredible places that pack the power of surprise. Did you know that there's a 1,000-room palace in southern Italy that rivals Versailles? As we travel to Caserta to visit this very special Reggia (it even made an appearance in Star Wars) we also discover the province of Caserta just might be home to the world's best pizza made by one of the world's up and coming chefs Franco Pepe. \r\n\r\nAs Americans expand their horizons for more adventurous lives and retirements abroad, we return to one of our favorite regions - Abruzzo - filled with both mountains and coastlines and meet four Americans who have taken advantage of very affordable real estate and health care and moved here. We also visit a town selling those famous 1-euro homes to see what the hype is about. \r\n\r\nThis third season of DREAM OF ITALY has something for everyone who loves Italy!",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Doctor Blake Mysteries is an Australian television series which premiered on ABC1 on Friday 1 February 2013 at 8:30 p.m.[1] The series stars Craig McLachlan in the lead role of Dr Lucien Blake, who returns home to Ballarat in 1959 to take over his deceased father's general medical practice after an absence of 30 years. Dr Blake is a keeper of secrets and a solver of mysteries.  \r\n Craig McLachlan as Dr Lucien Blake\r\nNadine Garner as Jean Beazley\r\nJoel Tobeck as Matthew Laws\r\nCate Wolfe as Mattie Obrien\r\nRick Donald as Daniel Parks\r\n\r\nThe Doctor Blake Mysteries is an original 10-part murder mystery series starring one of Australia’s favourite and most versatile actors, Craig McLachlan, as the maverick country town doctor Lucien Blake. A risk-taker, he’s impulsive and not afraid to upset the status quo. \r\n\r\nIt’s 1959. Dr Blake has returned to a place he once called home, to take over his deceased father’s medical practice. Everything seems peaceful on the surface, but seething underneath are the age-old passions of a regional town clashing head-on with the tensions and fears of the decade to come. \r\n\r\nHaunted by the horrors of war, his own personal loss and changed by his experiences as a POW, the wry, dry, yet very human Dr Blake undertakes his other role as police surgeon with precision and gusto - yet many find his unpredictable and unconventional manner unnerving. Ahead of his time, Blake looks to the science of forensics and his own understanding of the human heart to help solve the mysteries that inevitably come his way. \r\n\r\nBeside Blake, helping and at times hindering, are his housekeeper Jean (Nadine Garner), her nephew Danny (Rick Donald), a young constable, District Nurse Mattie O’Brien (Cate Wolfe) and Chief Superintendent Matthew Lawson (Joel Tobeck).\r\n\r\nChange is seeping through the cracks of post-World War II values, and endless fears abound – fear of communism, nuclear testing, rock ‘n’ roll music, immigration and social breakdown. Dr Blake’s community turns to him for guidance in medical matters and so much more. They tell him everything. Everyone trusts the doctor and he has a damn good nose for things left unsaid. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Description: Ella Fitzgerald is regarded by many as the greatest jazz singer of all time and was one of the dominant figures in the genre throughout the second half of the twentieth century. 1969 saw her debut appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, a stage she was to grace many more times.

Whatever the material, this concert proves that Ella could always swing.\r\nTracklisting:\r\n1. Give Me The Simple Life\r\n2. This Girl's In Love With You\r\n3. I Won't Dance\r\n4. A Place For Lovers\r\n5. That Old Black Magic\r\n6. Useless Landscape\r\n7. I Love You Madly\r\n8. Trouble Is A Man\r\n9. A Man And A Woman\r\n10. Sunshine Of Your Love\r\n11.

      "ProgramSummary": "Elmore Leonard has influenced more writers in America than any author since Ernest Hemingway (Leonard's mentor). Leonard's America is as real as Twain's Hannibal, Faulkner's Mississippi, Steinbeck's Monterey. From his westerns and early novels of crime based in Detroit and South Florida, right through his complex and virtually plotless later work, Elmore Leonard dissected an America whose founding sins have continued to haunt it all the days.\r\n\r\nAuthor of more than 40 novels, Leonard was especially known for his crackling dialogue and dark humor. Many of his writings were adapted for film and tv, including Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Jackie Brown, and 3:10 to Yuma. The Hollywood Reporter ranked him No. 2 on their list of \"Hollywood's 25 Most Powerful Authors\" in 2012, behind Stephen King (who once called Leonard \"the great American writer\"). He was a top-selling writer from the 1980s through his death in 2013.  \r\nfrom the 1980s through his death in 2013\r\nNot simply one of the finest crime novelists of the past half-century, Elmore Leonard is one of the finest novelists of the era.  ELMORE LEONARD: BUT DON'T TRY TO WRITE explores why -- tracing Leonard's career, writing process and his influence. The documentary features exclusive images with previously unseen home movie footage, family photographs and in-depth interviews with literary experts and those who knew him well, including colleagues, family, and childhood friends.\r\n",

In the late-1950's the USS Arizona Memorial Commission was struggling to raise money for a memorial that should have been fully funded by now. After all, 1,1777 crewmen died on December 7, 1941, on the battleship, over 900 of them still entombed aboard her today. It was the 1950's and perhaps most Americans just wanted to put World War II behind them, but still, the USS Arizona needed more than just a plaque attached to her rusting hull to memorialize all those who saw their lives abruptly ended on that Sunday morning at Pearl Harbor. A day of infamy that launched the United States into World War II.",

      "ProgramSummary": "\r\nThe United Kingdom is home to British people from hugely diverse ethnic backgrounds, as well as the British expatriates who, after generations of colonial settlement, returned to the mother country. Although they represent different cultures and experiences, all these people share a common heritage; they are the children, grandchildren or great grandchildren of the Empire. \r\n\r\nEach film in this six-part series will tell the individual story of a well-known Briton who is a child of the Empire, following the story of their family's past as the personal entwines with the historical. From their powerful, personal voyage of discovery emerges a picture of the wider, collective experience of migration within, and the dismantling of, an Empire. Taking part in the series are actress Dame Diana Rigg, former Liberal Democrat leader David Steel, actor Adrian Lester, comedienne Jenny Eclair, Shameless star Chris Bisson and Coronation Street's Shobna Gulati.\r\n\r\nDiana Rigg grew up in India in the final days of the British Raj. In Empire’s Children she follows in her parents’ footsteps, to discover how her working-class father ended up working for Maharajahs, and the impact Indian Independence had on her family’s life. \r\n\r\nChris Bisson discovers how the British Empire forced his Indian great-grandfather to end up as a poverty-stricken labourer in Trinidad, and drove his wealthy grandfather to gamble everything on a new life in Britain. \r\n\r\nFifty years after his family returned from the British colony of Kenya, David Steel realised that his father never revealed the whole truth about what happened during their time in Africa. He discovers what provoked his Presbyterian Minister father to take on the British Empire in a dramatic and very public protest. \r\n\r\nAs a child Jenny Eclair stumbled across gruesome photographs that her father had kept of dead Chinese Communist Terrorists in Malaya. Now Jenny wants to find out what they mean and why her father was fighting a now largely forgotten war in Malaysia in the 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe British Empire has shaped Adrian Lester’s family history in ways he has never realised. In Empire’s Children Adrian discovers why his grandfather risked everything to travel 5,000 miles to Britain from Jamaica and what happened when his family arrived. \r\n\r\nThe end of the British Empire brought prosperity and tragedy in equal measure to Shobna Gulati’s family. Shobna traces her family’s imperial past from the hills of the Punjab in Pakistan to the north of England. \r\n\r\n(from Wall to Wall website)\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Throughout its history Mexico has been convulsed by   a series of epic, violent and bloody struggles that have defined the culture and identity of this complex nation.\r\nThis 4x 1 hour mini-series looks at this often-overlooked history of America’s next-door neighbour, a history that has both been influenced and involved the United States. Despite this, relatively little is known of the events that have shaped Mexico, and how those events are reflected in the character of the country today.\r\nWhile the world maybe aware of the Spanish conquest led by Hernan Cortes and his fellow Conquistadors in the 16th century, and the devastating impact this conquest had  on Mexico’s pre-Hispanic civilizations, an exploration of how events unfolded in the subsequent four hundred years until the Mexican revolution, has largely been ignored.\r\nWhile the names of Cortes, Zapata, Villa, Santa Ana and Rivera are familiar, and the Battle of the Alamo identified as an iconic American historic event, the precise role played by these names and places and events, such as the  Mexican-American War, remain somewhat of a mystery to anyone outside Mexico.\r\nThis is a history of conquest with all its bloody and dramatic consequences; not just of battles and wars, but of feuds, shifting alliances, trickery, intrigue, executions, assassination and exile.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "He is known as \"America's storyteller.\" Famed WWII correspondent, and Hoosier, Ernie Pyle remains one of the most accomplished and beloved journalists in American history.\r\n\r\nErnie Pyle: Life in the Trenches is a 90-minute WTIU documentary that tells the story of the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist who reached millions each week with stories about ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nPyle is best remembered for his firsthand reports from the foxholes alongside American troops during World War II. He is also celebrated for his writings as he traveled across the US during the lean years of the Great Depression, revealing the trials and triumphs of hundreds of common Americans. This documentary chronicles not only the bloody battles in Europe and Japan, but also the internal battles Pyle constantly faced with heavy drinking, depression, and a troubled marriage.\r\n\r\nErnie Pyle: Life in the Trenches reveals that through two of the darkest chapters in America's history, the voice of Ernie Pyle became the voice of the American people--a voice of promise, grit, and determination.\r\n\r\nThe program is narrated by Emmy award-winning journalist and former CBS News anchor Dan Rather. \r\nActor Jonathan Banks--from TV series Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul--gives voice to Ernie Pyle and his most acclaimed writings and personal correspondence to his closest friends and family. \r\nThe film also includes notable interviews with the late Walter Cronkite and Andy Rooney, as well as a number of World War II veterans, contemporary journalists, and historians.\r\n",

While describing the many birds of the story, the music introduces and expands the audience's knowledge of the orchestra instruments by featuring the auxiliary instruments of the woodwind section. ",

Heinz made Eva promise if he should die in the camps, she would retrieve the artwork. Today, his story sits in the shadow of the better-known DIARY OF ANNE FRANK. After the war, Eva became the posthumous stepsister of Anne when her mother married Anne’s father. While the world knows Anne’s story, this film introduces Heinz, his artistry, and his sister’s efforts to find and share his remarkable legacy.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Have you ever wondered why some people connect so easily with classical music, while statistically as much as 95 percent of the U.S. population has trouble \"getting into it\"? The music series FALL IN LOVE WITH MUSIC is a fun exploration of the listening process.\r\n\r\nDeveloped over years of classroom and lecture interaction, this series offers streamlined, effective pathways to musical understanding based on the education strategies of Dr. Saul Feinberg, a pioneer and recognized authority in the teaching of music listening skills. Conceived and presented by George Marriner Maull, artistic director of The Discovery Orchestra, the eight-part series explores the following topics: hearing versus listening; the open mind; why aren't we listening?; the elements of music; thinking and feeling like a composer; grasping musical \"paragraphs\"; and learning to listen flexibly.\r\n\r\nThe series invites viewers to solve very specific musical \"problems\" such as: How many times does this theme occur? Can you tell when the pitches descend? How many melodies are occurring simultaneously? Composers featured in the episodes include: J.S. Bach, Bartok, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Monk, Mozart, Rachmaninoff and Schuman in both pre-recorded excerpts and \"live\" musical examples. Sharing the stage with Maestro Maull in the \"live\" musical segments are the Amphion String Quartet and the Dan Crisci Jazz Quartet.\r\n\r\nThe listening skills acquired through FALL IN LOVE WITH MUSIC will help viewers understand, enjoy and better connect with all of the music in their lives\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "FAMOUS NATHAN is the insider documentary by Lloyd Handwerker, grandson of Nathan Handwerker, who founded the legendary Brooklyn eatery and iconic New York institution, Nathan’s Famous, in Coney Island in 1916. Over a thirty-year period, Lloyd has filmed, archived and researched the story of both his grandfather and the family-run business. The film contains never before heard audio recordings of Nathan describing his upbringing in a poor village in Poland, emigration to New York and details of creating and running Nathan’s for over forty years. Featuring interviews with extended family, friends and the employees who helped make Nathan’s the prototype for fast-food made with quality, love and care, it is also very much a story of labor and a chronicle of the people who spent their lives in the employ of Nathan’s. Their devotion to serving millions of customers in the hustle-bustle, nano-second speed, day in and day out grind of the restaurant is clear. Rich in nostalgia, FAMOUS NATHAN pushes the boundaries of conventional documentary filmmaking, as kaleidoscopic and layered as Coney Island itself, capturing the honky-tonk, in-your-face spirit that was Nathan’s Famous in its hey-day and today.

      "ProgramSummary": "\"Fat Boy: The Billy Stewart Story\", a documentary which tells of the life and career of one of the most popular Rhythm and Blues singers of the 1960s. The documentary is produced and directed by Emmy Award winning documentary filmmaker Beverly Lindsay-Johnson through her company Kendall Productions LLC, under the fiscal sponsorship of the African American Music Association (AAMA) of Washington, DC. \r\n\"Fat Boy: The Billy Stewart Story\" examines the journey of this incredible singer from his days as a young piano player to a famous Rhythm and Blues balladeer of the 1960s. He battled being overweight reaching at times 300 pounds. His passion for singing in his early years made him a Washington DC legend as he sang in many DC area nightclubs from U Street to the local favorite Shelter Room in Northeast Washington, DC. Stewart was known to break out singing on the sidewalks of DC. He was a favorite at the Howard Theater in DC, The Apollo Theater in New York and other concert theaters along the \"Chittlin' Circuit\". Many of his songs spoke of sadness and the desire of meeting a \"girl to love\", but he aimed to please his fans and his fans loved him. He also wrote a song entitled \"Fat Boy\" where he spoke of living the good life despite his weight and health issues. It is also said that he could be cantankerous at times. A story has it that he and Rhythm and Blues legend, Wilson Pickett, were having an argument and they both pulled guns on each other. \r\nBilly Stewart tragically died when on January 17, 1970 his car plunged into the Neuse River in Smithfield, North Carolina. He and his band were in route to a performance in Columbia, South Carolina. Stewart and 3 of his band members riding in his car were killed as the car sank into the river. The remaining band members were driving in a separate car which was not included in the accident. The coroner's report and recollections by residents give details at the tragic scene. \r\nBilly Stewart's musical legacy lives on through renditions of his music performed by contemporary artists. \r\nNarrated by former radio and television announcer Charlie Neal, the story of Billy Stewart, his career and personal life will be told with interviews by family, friends and musicians in Washington, DC who knew him best such as pianist and former Chess recording artist Curtis Prince, Herb Fame of the legendary singing duo Peaches and Herb, and Ronald \"Poozie\" Miles of the Rainbows who puts to rest the stories as to whether Billy Stewart sat in regularly with The Rainbows, and his cousin Grace Ruffin of The Jewels. Also, interviews with author and musical historian Robert Pruter \"Chicago Soul\", who provides historical background of Stewart's time as a recording artist for the historic Chess record label. A special interview with former Chess recording artist Sugar Pie DeSanto who co-wrote one of Billy Stewart's popular tunes \"Love Me\". Interviews with former legendary Chess recording label musicians and songwriters Willie Henderson and Raynard Miner, and Chess label mate Mitty Collier (\"I Had A Talk With My Man Last Night\"). The Collier, Henderson and Miner interview took place in the former Chess Records building in Chicago, now the Willie Dixon Blues Heaven Foundation. Emanuel Raheim LeBlanc, lead singer and founder of the 1970s Rhythm and Blues band, GQ, covered Billy Stewart's \"I Do Love You\" and \"Sitting In The Park\" and had major hits with these songs tells of the influence of Billy Stewart's music on GQ. \r\nA special interview with \"Little Anthony\" of Doo-Wop legends Little Anthony and The Imperials tells of the 30-day cross-country concert tour he and Billy Stewart performed on the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars in the 1960s. \r\n\r\nArchival photographs and films provide the visuals that tell the story of this unusual singer. Special \"never before seen\" clips of 8mm films of Billy Stewart with his family, performing in various night clubs and the funeral service for Billy Stewart will be included in \"Fat Boy: The Billy Stewart Story\". \r\nA special closing segment titled \"Keeping the Legacy of Billy Stewart\" describes the influence Billy Stewart and his music of the 1960s has on contemporary artists of Rhythm and Blues, Hip Hop and Go-Go music. Interviews include Dane Riley (cousin of Billy Stewart), Jas Funk (Go-Go music performer and Entertainer), Paul Benavidez (Latin singer and musician), Trish Toledo (named the \"Latina Soul Diva\"), and Alex Stassi of England. \r\nMajor funding is provided by HumanitiesDC with additional funding provided by private donations.  \r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Finding Fellowship %0D\r\nA  film about belonging and building community in a divided world.%0D\r\n\"We haven't been this divided since 1968.\"  This paralyzing refrain has been uttered over and over, louder and louder, in response to the current political and social tumult, almost to suggest that we are only spectators with no role to play or stake in the outcome.  We were compelled to tell a story from 1968 - a time when the country was indisputably divided - to demonstrate our capacity, even in dark times, to come together.%0D\r\nBased in the historic community of Quince Orchard, Maryland, Finding Fellowship captures how the seeds for potential reconciliation were planted in the same fields where slave masters once terrorized.  Three racially-segregated churches, born out of the Civil War, each had fallen on hard financial times.  The Black church gathered one evening to discuss its uncertain future.  As members debated the consequences of merging with the two local white congregations, the minister interrupted to announce that Martin Luther King, Jr. had just been murdered in Memphis, TN.  April 4, 1968.%0D\r\nDespite King's assassination, though others argue because of it, those three churches voted to merge their congregations into one.  In September 1968 each had its last racially segregated service.  %0D\r\nThe reality is not every member stayed.  Each church lost members.  And the hardest decision wasn't to come together but to stay together.  Yet, because of their efforts, in September of 2018, Fairhaven United Methodist Church celebrated its 50th year of purposeful integration.%0D\r\n\"Buildings didn't merge.  People did.  The descendants of former slaves and former slave owners.\"%0D\r\nFinding Fellowship is a story of the possible that reminds us that a diverse people purposefully coming together - hand in hand and heart to heart - is one of the most powerful forces this world has ever known and that the capacity to come together has always been, and will always be, ours.%0D\r\n %0D\r\nDOERS DO.%0D\r\nIn 2013, brother and sister team Jason Green and Kisha (Green) Davis decided to spend time with their ailing 95-year-old grandmother. From her hospital room, she shared stories of her hometown - Quince Orchard, Maryland - and the people who built and sustained the community through the years. %0D\r\nLike many communities across the country, Quince Orchard endured significant change - a transition from rural to suburban, significant demographic and population shifts, and even a name change to reflect its new affluence. Finding Fellowship explores the uniquely American story of how the members of this once rural, once racially segregated community intentionally put their differences aside to come together amidst one America's most turbulent moments. %0D\r\nIn the wake of George Floyd, as the country, again, explores our depths of division, this film shares how one community came together in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, and offers an example of how communities can lean on their shared heritage to progress.  Finding Fellowship reminds us that we each have the ability and responsibility to shape our communities. %0D\r\nMore than a place on a map, Quince Orchard is a spirit and the film dives into what makes a community thrive through its people, heritage, and history. And how that history must be actively preserved.%0D\r\nIt started with a schoolhouse.  Filmmaker Jason Green was surprised to learn that his great, great grandfather, just three years after the end of slavery, helped build a school on the main road for the education of \"colored children.\"  He asked his grandmother whether there was a safer way to educate in 1868. She replied that the colored children of the community needed a school, and those community members looked around and saw that need and acted because they were doers and doers do. %0D\r\nIn 1968, on the heels of MLK's assassination, three poor, rural, segregated Methodist churches - two white and one black church - again adopted this spirit of doers do to merge together in fellowship. %0D\r\nFinding Fellowship, with a few surprises along the way, explores the unlikely church merger, how the community has maintained over the last 50 years, and dips into the past to offer a glimpse of the future. %0D\r\nTHE FILMMAKERS.%0D\r\nJASON GREEN, DIRECTOR %25252526 CO-PRODUCER%0D\r\nJason Green, Director and Co-Producer, is an attorney, entrepreneur, and public speaker who empowers individuals and communities.

The initial objective is to bring awareness of the multitude of fabrics that are manufactured around the world, and secondly to teach us how to \"weave\" these fabrics into our personal lives and tastes. The selection of fabrics is a very personal vision based on our lifestyle and environment and therefore it is crucial to have an educated understanding to match our persona. Series 10 will include a wide range of fabrics from Mardi Gras attire to actual space suits worn by our astronauts. We will help you learn how to utilize a wide array of fabrics into your daily routines, and will include the proper procedure of cleaning those fabrics. \r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Five Demands is a riveting story about the student strike that changed the face of higher education. In April 1969, a small group of Black and Puerto Rican students shut down the City College of New York, an elite public university located in the heart of Harlem. \r\n\r\nAlthough the late 1960s are known as an era of student activism, this momentous event has been overlooked and forgotten. Far more attention has been paid to white middle-class students in opposition to the Vietnam War, yet this protest had the greater impact: the CCNY strikers were the vanguard of a national Black student movement that transformed the culture, the mission, and the curriculum of American higher education. CCNYs strike was homegrown in Harlem, the most famous Black neighborhood in America.  The Harlem community rallied around the students and for many it was the first time they ever stepped foot on the stunning neo-Gothic campus on a hill overlooking their neighborhood. National television news covered the strike, but within a few years this heroic struggle for educational equity was swept under the proverbial rug. \r\n\r\nFueled by the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation, the strike turned into an uprising, leading to the extended occupation of the campus, classes being canceled, students being arrested, and the resignation of the college president. Told through the point of view of the participants, the film follows the students struggle against the institutional racism that, for over a century, had shut out people of color from this and other public universities. The Five Demands proves that a handful of ordinary citizens can band together to take action and effect meaningful change.\r\n\r\nThe Five Demands is co-produced and co-directed by internationally-acclaimed documentary filmmaker Greta Schiller and Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and author Andrea Weiss, both co-founders of Jezebel Pictures, and executive produced by Stanley Nelson of Firelight Films.   Greta Schillers past work includes the international favorites Before Stonewall (1984 Emmy Award, 2019 National Film Registry);  International Sweethearts of Rhythm (PBS, 1986 Best Doc, Philadelphia Film Festival);  Paris Was a Woman (1995 Audience Award Winner, Berlinale); and The Man Who Drove with Mandela (PBS, 1998 Best Documentary at Berlinale).  Andrea Weiss credits include Bones of Contention, a feature documentary delving into the historical memory movement in Spain and the unknown story of LGBT repression under the Franco dictatorship; Escape to Life: The Erika and Klaus Mann Story; Seed of Sarah; Paris Was a Woman; Before Stonewall; A Bit of Scarlet;  and International Sweethearts of Rhythm, among others.  Stanley Nelson is among the premier documentary filmmakers working today. His body of work has garnered every major award in the industry. He is a MacArthur Genius Fellow, was awarded an individual Peabody Award, the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts Sciences, and received the National Medal in the Humanities from President Barack Obama.  His credits include the PBS films Harriet Tubman: Voices of Freedom; Becoming Frederick Douglass; Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool; Tell Them We Are Rising: The Story of Black Colleges and Universities; and The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "SYNOPSIS: \r\n\r\nWhy is Robert A. “Bob” Hoover’s airplane, Sweetie Face, in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, but the general public has never heard of him?  Why is he number three on the list of the Smithsonian’s 100 greatest aviators of all time? \r\n\r\nBob dreamed of being a WWII fighter pilot but was too tall, with poor eyesight and an acute case of air sickness. With determination and outside the box thinking, he overcame these barriers to accomplish his goal of becoming a fighter pilot in WWII.  Shot down by the Germans and captured, Bob was sent to Stalag Luft I where he eventually escaped, stole an enemy aircraft, and flew himself to freedom in Holland. Upon returning to the states, he was assigned to the most secret development programs the United States was engaged in at the time — in the “The Right Stuff” days where programs lost an inordinate number of pilots in mishaps and accidents.\r\n\r\nBob went on to become an accomplished experimental test pilot, participant in breaking the speed of sound and launching the world into the Jet Age. \r\n\r\nBob’s influence over generations of aviators includes Harrison Ford, Dick and Burt Rutan, Carroll Shelby, Neil Armstrong, General Bud Day, and world premiere air show pilot Sean D. Tucker, who gather to discuss and celebrate this humble legend.\r\n\r\nIn his later career as an air show performer Bob became known for shutting his engines off and “feathering” his propellers then performing a graceful pattern of loops and rolls, a routine never before or since replicated.  Hoover performed in front of more people, in more countries, in more different aircraft, than any individual before or since.  \r\n\r\nFlying the Feathered Edge preserves the stories, the friendships, and the legacy that surrounds a beloved pilot who quietly touched the trajectory of aviation’s many developments. \r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "This documentary blends stage performance with archival footage to highlight the remarkable life and work of AIDS activist Brent Nicholson Earle. At the height of the epidemic, Earle refused to watch his friends suffer due to government inaction and public ignorance about the disease. His audacious response in 1986 was to embark on a 10,000-mile run around the perimeter of the United States to draw attention to the plight of AIDS patients, all while overcoming public backlash, a homophobic media blackout, his own health challenges, and an inconvenient lack of any long-distance training. After enduring blisters, exhaustion, ignorance and fear, he returns home to his own HIV diagnosis. Though the run finishes, Brent's activism never stops.\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Filmed Stage Hit GROUCHO Stars NYC Theatre World Award Winner %2526 London Laurence Olivier Nominee Frank Ferrante  \r\n\r\n\"In the divisive times we live in today, there is one commonality we all share: the need to laugh. And there is plenty and more in Ferrante's 'Groucho,' the one-man show about one of the funniest comedians of the 20th century.\" - The New York Times, March, 2017 \r\n\r\nDubbed \"nothing short of masterful\" by the Chicago Tribune, Frank Ferrante's GROUCHO is a laughter filled, theatrical portrait of \"America's most gifted funnyman\" (The New York Times). Written and performed by Ferrante, the filmed play with music celebrates the style and spirit of comedian Groucho Marx (1890-1977) whose irreverent humor continues to influence artists. Born the middle son of Jewish immigrants, Groucho never made it past sixth grade yet for 70 years he exhilarated audiences in every entertainment form.  GROUCHO invites viewers to revel in the legend's prime seen here on full display - complete with greasepaint, keen wit and unbridled comic physicality. The program is equal parts improvisation, story telling, song and stand-up comedy with Ferrante's 'Groucho' liberally ad-libbing throughout. \r\n\r\nPerformed for 35 years over 3,000 times in more than 500 cities, Ferrante's 'Groucho' played New York Off-Broadway, London's West End, Los Angeles and two Australian tours. For the role, Ferrante earned the New York Theatre World Award and a London Laurence Olivier Award nomination for 'Comedy Performance of the Year.' \r\n\r\nDirected for the stage and screen by Dreya Weber. Filmed at two-time Tony Award-winning Cincinnati Playhouse. Running time: 1:26:46\r\n",

The aim of the concert was to celebrate Freddie's life and work, but also to increase public\r\nawareness of the awful disease which prematurely ended his life. All the guest artists offered their participation for free. The concert was broadcast live on television and radio in 76 countries, from the USA to Russia. The 72,000 people who were fortunate enough to see the\r\nconcert live did so in glorious Spring weather in front of a stage 370ft wide and 90 ft deep.",

      "ProgramSummary": "#1 Thought Police examines the long history of governments suppressing speech, with clear echoes of George Orwell's warning of a world without free speech. The program weaves personal stories from individuals from Hong Kong, North Korea, and Peru whose governments tried to suppress free speech, one of them resulting in a monumental, and avoidable, human tragedy. \r\n\r\n#2 Challenging either religious or scientific dogma can prove explosive. The One True Faith looks at the once-sacrilegious beliefs of Galileo and shows the uproar caused by the Scopes Monkey Trial. The program also examines the work of Nobel Laureate Barry Marshall who proved that ulcers were caused by bacteria and explores the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo that led to a horrifying massacre.\r\n\r\n#3 The Speech We Hate features a Kenyan filmmaker whose love story of two women garnered a nationwide ban. Viewers also meet a Turkish political artist who was censored for his provocative work in the U.S., a hip-hop historian who recalls the arrest of members of 2 Live Crew for obscenity, and a student who took a lawsuit over banned books in his school all the way to the Supreme Court.

      "ProgramSummary": "In 1967, Pittsburgh's inner city produced Americaâ€™s first EMT service. Comprised solely of Black men and women recruited from the cityâ€™s Hill District neighborhood, the paramedics of Freedom House Ambulance became trailblazers in providing pre-hospital and CPR care. Freedom House was initially conceived to respond to the needs of Pittsburghâ€™s African American community who often times, couldnâ€™t rely on police and fire departments during an emergency. Their ground breaking work became the basis for all paramedics training in the country. However, despite its success - racism and power dynamics in Pittsburgh shut down Freedom House in 1975, leaving its legacy almost lost to history. This 30-minute documentary explores the rise and fall of Freedom House Ambulance. With rare archival images, the program features the story of inception from an original founder, compelling reflections of surviving paramedics, stories of the world-renowned doctors who trained them, and memories of lifelong Hill District residents.

      "ProgramSummary": "From Wall Street to Bay Street is a one-hour documentary that examines and compares the financial and banking systems of the United States and Canada. The basis for both financial systems was laid by the revolutionary founding father - Alexander Hamilton. In a sense he was the %E2%80%98father' of banking in both countries.  Canada built its banking system on the Hamiltonian model and never departed from its Hamiltonian roots. The United States, however, turned its back on Hamilton's financial system in the 1830s when President Andrew Jackson destroyed the Second Bank of the US. The documentary traces the history of both systems from inception to the current day and through the many crises that occurred.  From Wall Street to Bay Street interviews an impressive list of experts that includes a former Prime Minister, Bank CEO's, Academics and other business leaders.  The documentary provides excellent perspectives on the volatility we have experienced in recent years which may help us avoid the next financial panic. \r\n",

He battles stage 4 cancer while also facing down gentrification, which threatens to turn their historically Black neighborhood into an historical plaque or a fading memory. As developers begin to replace the churches and homes that have been the heart of the community for generations, Pastor Fuzz steps up to guide his First Corinthian flock and protect his home. \r\n\r\nThe story of a man's and a community's fight to survive, Pastor Fuzz's journey highlights the power of unity and the strength that comes from standing up for what you believe in. This is a tale of courage, hope, and the determination to safeguard a place and the people who have called it home for over a century.",

      "ProgramSummary": "GardenFit is returning for another season of bringing gardening and fitness together with the goal of helping everyday gardeners learn how to take care of their body while taking care of their garden. In Season One we featured a diverse group of guest gardeners for whom gardening was their principal passion...or even their profession; for Season Two, we're going to visit artists who are well known in other fields but also passionate gardeners: painters, sculptors, musicians, and culinary pioneers, along with floral, interior, and jewelry designers, whose art has been inspired by nature and whose gardens reflect their artistic visions.\r\n\r\nGardenFit teaches a way to garden with awareness of how your body works that debunks the accepted notion that aches and pains are inevitable. The series enables gardeners to address any physical challenges and continue to pursue their passion for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nMadeline Hooper, GardenFit Creator, Executive Producer and Host is joined by fitness trainer Adam Schersten. GardenFit spotlights a different guest gardener in every episode, sharing distinctive gardening insights and tips during tours of their gardens. Schersten works with the guests to help identify their specific physical problems and the causes and shows simple body tune-ups they can apply while gardening to alleviate their aches and pains, allowing them to enjoy gardening every day. Each episode ends with the guests having a special celebration with Madeline and Adam and sharing their artistic work. Filmed in a captivating cinematic style, complemented by dramatic aerial footage, the series shows off each gardener's personal environment in a variety of regional locations across America. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Author and academic Gerda Saunders was diagnosed with cerebral microvascular disease, a precursor of dementia, and has been living with the disease for over a decade. She embarks on a journey of self-discovery and inquiry as the effects of the illness begin to unravel her identity.Born and raised in South Africa during the early years of apartheid, Gerda was shaped by her academic experiences and questioning nature. Her childhood academic success carried over into a career of writing and teaching math, science, English, and gender studies. But at the prime of her life's work, Gerda's brain began to fail her. Her degenerative brain became a new space for study from a scientific and personal perspective. \"Every time my brain suffers an additional insult, I have less brain power to puzzle out my remaining self,\"Gerda says.Filmed over the course of six years, Gerda moves through her changing realities with intimacy and honesty in front of the camera. Observational footage draws us into her psychological experience as she navigates the loss of certain parts of her intellectual identity in real time. While her verbal skills remain strong, she articulates her experience of dementia with groundbreaking nuance, poetry and vulnerability--and as she does so, we see the toll it takes on her over the years. As the disease progresses, Gerda reveals what remains of who she is and what pieces she must let goof. Creative expression through unconventional personal style becomes her whim, \r\nreplacing an ever-diminishing ability to write. Gerda knows this piece of her identity will one day also disappear. Months of isolation and separation from family and friends during a pandemic create further anxiety and agitation, pulling Gerda deeper into herself, and despair. Peter, Gerda's husband of 50 years, is witness to her day-to-day decline. With tenderness and patience, he creates safe spaces and manages Gerda's daily regimen: tracking her solo walks with his GPS, making the bed together, assisting Gerda with her online blog, and helping plan her day--often accompanied by laughter and a personal touch. But watching Gerda succumb to her brain's fractured pathways takes an emotional toll on Peter. He asks,\"what will I do without my sweet? My Gerda?\" There is beauty and grace in Gerda's story--a teacher and scientist grounded in reality, she educates us on what memory loss feels like, observing pieces of her identity as they slowly fall away. In the end, Gerda will attempt to reclaim the control dementia holds over her by choosing how she will leave this world.\"There will come a time when I don't care or know who I am,\" says Gerda. \"When physical life stops, everything about you reverts to chaos. That moment when you cease having ability to make your mark in the world as a human, when that is gone... I don't feel sadness for the body that is left.",

      "ProgramSummary": "SYNOPSIS\r\n\"getting dot OLDER\" is a strongly hosted Lifestyle Doc TV/Online Interactive series focusing on intimate personal revelations about aging, primarily featuring diverse Baby Boomers, all across America.\r\n\r\nEPISODE FORMAT\r\nHost/Producer Roberto Mighty leads with strong studio wraparounds, and also conducts the interviews on locations across the USA. \r\n\r\nEach half-hour episode begins with the series open; preview clips/soundbites; and an invitation for viewers to respond online after the show. Then, three diverse Americans from across the country (ex: Alaska, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Massachusetts, Missouri) are individually featured in 7-minute segments.   \r\n\r\nEach segment begins with brief biographical clips from a day in the life of that person. These action-oriented clips are designed to give audiences important clues about this subject's age, family situation, gender orientation, income, living arrangements, etc. The  bio clips are then interspersed with intimate revelations gleaned from our unique \"getting dot OLDER\" interview process. \r\n\r\nUNIQUE INTERVIEW PROCESS\r\nEvery show participant is asked the same 21 questions, in the same order. However, a 7-minute segment will only include responses to 3 or 4 questions. Interviews take place in locations that are meaningful to the lifestyle of the participant. In some cases, that could mean the person's living room.

      "ProgramSummary": "\"getting dot OLDER'' Season 2 continues our â€˜docu-talkâ€™ format â€“ talkinâ€™ â€˜bout my generation â€“ Baby Boomers! From deeply poignant to laugh-out-loud funny, Host/Executive Producer Roberto Mighty helps diverse â€˜regular peopleâ€™ across the country share their deepest feelings on life, love, spirituality, family, health and intimacy. Focusing on intimate personal revelations about aging, each subject is asked the same questions designed to produce heartfelt responses. The most engaging 3 or 4 exchanges are included in each segment. The participant mix is carefully curated for maximum storytelling impact and inclusiveness. \r\n \r\nExcerpts from these zoom interview clips are interspersed with brief commentaries by experts from Harvard University, Howard University, Johns Hopkins Medical School, and other respected institutions.  \r\n \r\nNew features for Season 2 include on-location reports with Boomers pursuing their â€œHobbies, Pastimes and Passionsâ€, including animal rescue; civil war reenactment; choir singing; community volunteering; and other activities. Boomer artists and musicians share their post-retirement pivots in our â€œVisiting Artistâ€ short segments. In addition to tell-all interviews, the episodes also feature lighthearted, Boomer-centric content, including quizzes and calls for viewer input.\r\n\r\nWe believe in an expanded concept of inclusiveness. Our goal is to include every kind of American in this series. Taken together, our content underscores the common humanity of aging. Viewer engagement is very high.",

      "ProgramSummary": "For decades, Washington, DC has been a beacon for Black culture and community. Now, however, a wave of economic and cultural gentrification occurring at breakneck speed threatens to erase this history.  \"Go-Go City: Displacement & Protest in Washington, DC\" dives into this rich and colorful tapestry and the forces behind the gentrification that stand to mute it. The documentary  film interweaves scenes of protest as displaced communities take to the streets to rally around the city's beloved Go-Go music. Featuring interviews with legends of Go-Go such as Big Tony of Trouble Funk, Sugar Bear, and Anwan 'Big G' Clover, as well as business leaders such as Richard 'Dickie' Shannon of Horace and Dickie's and Virginia Ali of Ben's Chili Bowl, the film offers an historical overview of the cultural and economic forces that made Washington, DC \"Chocolate City.\"  The film follows as protesters for racial justice took to the District's streets in the summer of 2020, and as Go-Go music takes on another life as an agent for change. The documentary tracks this movement with scenes of protests and marches that often-centered Go-Go bands, performing live on the back of flatbed trucks. \"Go-Go City: Displacement & Protest in Washington, DC\" thus documents a poetic moment in which the long-term citizens of Washington, DC - the communities most impacted by rampant gentrification - rally around their unique music to retake the streets and make their voices heard.   As protest organizer Terrence Odom says in a poem that opens the film, \"Just sit back and listen. This is a new resistance.\"",

      "ProgramSummary": "A documentary on World Champion, Two-Time Olympian and Five-Time National Champion pairs figure skater Randy Gardner. \r\n\"You just don't know in sports. It's that night. It's that moment.\" -- Randy Gardner \r\nOnce upon a time in Long Beach California, a World Champion was born.\r\nGO FIGURE: THE RANDY GARDNER STORY, documents the life of the two-time Olympian, Randy Gardner, who paired with Tai Babilonia, and became the iconic figure skating pairs team, affectionately known as, Tai and Randy.\r\nDubbed \"America's Sweethearts\" by the press, Tai and Randy were the \"It\" couple poised to win the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics after coming off of their World Championship Gold Medal in Austria in 1979. The \"miracle on ice\" stage was set for the Americans to beat the long dominant Soviet Dynasty for a first time ever Olympic Gold in U.S. Pairs Skating. The entire country watched with anticipation and hope. But then, on that night, at that moment -- heartbreak on the world's stage.\r\nForty years later, Randy takes the courageous leap to share his very private and very personal story.\r\nA story that delves far beyond the glory of competition and unfulfilled Olympic dreams.  A story filled with family secrets, closeted sexuality and the price paid to keep it quiet. A story that is at once heartbreaking and uplifting in its ability to inspire greatness.\r\nGO FIGURE: THE RANDY GARDNER STORY is one man's quest to finally come to terms with his true identity.",

      "ProgramSummary": "\"This is a film about a fearless woman, Golda Meir, Israel's first female Prime Minister, who served during the Yom Kippur War when Egyptian troops stormed across the Suez Canal, overwhelmed the surprised Israeli troops, and Golda's superhuman efforts to avoid disaster. Adapted from the hit play by the same name, Valerie Harper plays Golda and multiple roles. It's her part of a lifetime and a great departure from the roles we are used to seeing her in. She brilliantly depicts Golda's struggles and frustrations with the Israeli generals including Moshe Dayan. Impressive and moving are the moments of Golda's efforts to persuade Kissinger to have Nixon send help to Israel. If she did not succeed it would be, as Dayan stated, the third destruction of the Temple. It would have meant the end of Israel. And there are also very touching, at times humorous, scenes of Golda's life, including coming to Israel from the U.S. and becoming one of the first pioneers. She succeeded in doing so, but at the same time, it ended her marriage.\" (Playbill.com quoting Quad Cinema)",

      "ProgramSummary": "THE GOOD ROAD – Synopsis\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD ROAD explores the complicated cocktail that is created when charity is introduced into a mixture of culture, politics, religion and history. In season two, each half-hour episode reveals a unique and astonishing location, and an engaging cast of characters that are real, gritty, insightful, funny, humbling and awe inspiring. It makes you look at global philanthropy in a whole new light! \r\n\r\nHosts Earl Bridges and Craig Martin—longtime  philanthropy veterans, globetrotters and best friends—trek around the world to meet people who are making a difference. As they explore familiar places like South Carolina, Virginia and Puerto Rico, and foreign destinations like Myanmar, Thailand and India, the duo discover the limitless power of good, and inspiring change-makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n101:  Richmond, Virginia: “Racial Reconciliation” (WT)\r\nAfter the killing of George Floyd, Richmond became a focus of international attention considering the city was the former Capital of the Confederacy.  Against that backdrop, Earl and Craig speak with influential members of the community hoping to bridge the gap of racial inequality and negativity. Dontrese Brown, a young, networked black entrepreneur shared his Hidden in Plain Site project (HiPS) which marries 360 video with historic images to shed light on famous and infamous sights in Richmond. Curator Valerie Oliver at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts talks about the impact and importance of Kehinde Wiley’s iconic statue, “Rumors of War” a hip-hop inspired replica of the J.E.B. Stuart statue, and the renaming of The Boulevard to Arthur Ashe Boulevard.  The purpose of these alterations is to set aside old and painful reminders of Richmond’s slave past, embracing a positive era of racial reconciliation and hope.     \r\n\r\nEpisode 102: San Juan, Puerto Rico: “State of Affairs” (WT)\r\nSan Juan is at the heart of a whole range of important contributions Puerto Rico has made in US history including things like art, sports, music and cuisine.  Craig and Earl explore the Old City, talking to artists, chefs and historians about that complex history. Sculptors Charles Juhász-Alvarado and Ana Rosa Rivera talk about their work in Viejo San Juan’s poorest community, La Perla, and how they have used art to enhance the lives of those living there.   Latino filmmaker Alberto Ferreras talks about how Puerto Rican identity fits into American culture and politics.  An interview with the ex-Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, reveals how San Juan managed to survive the devastating aftermath from Hurricane Maria.  And, a Dominican Republic immigrant community share the secrets behind their incredibly delicious street foods. \r\n\r\nEpisode 103: India: “An Education of India” (WT)\r\nEarl and Craig travel to Hyderabad, India to meet up with Earl’s old buddy, Harish Mamtani.  Harish runs a private school designed to help underprivileged students who are eager to learn with a better education than can be received elsewhere in the community.  Coming from an entrepreneurial background, Harish knows that innovation is the key to making the overwhelming task of providing effective education to students in poor communities possible.  On the itinerary is visiting Hyderabad’s historic Golconda Fort and Charminar Mosque as The Good Road team steps back in time to India’s ancient history.  A quick trip to Bangalore rounds out an exploration of South Central India’s two most important tech cities and takes viewers off the beaten path to understand not just the India of the past but the modern India of the present.  \r\nEpisode 104: “Shalom Y’all!” Charleston, South Carolina:  \r\nCharleston has been named the “best city in America” by Travel + Leisure magazine for 3 years running.  However, beneath the facade of plantation style mansions with oak trees covered in Spanish Moss one can stumble on the oldest Jewish community in America.  It also is home to the first Opera House, and the “Ellis Island” for slaves arriving from Africa.  Against this complex and messy history are stories of strength, vision and perseverance.  Earl and Craig get to share a cup of she-crab soup, with a side of shrimp and grits, with some of the most influential citizens of “the Holy City” and discover a charm from unexpected characters.\r\n\r\nEpisode 105: Bagan and Yangon, Myanmar:  \r\nA trip to the ancient city of Bagan provides a look into the mystery and mystical stories of ancient Myanmar.  Thousands upon thousands of pagodas - all with different shapes, colors and designs - dot the landscape.  Bagan was the ancient capital of the Pagan Kingdom which existed from the 9th to 13th centuries and was the first kingdom to bring the various regions into one state that would later constitute Myanmar.  Earl and Craig explore this ancient kingdom and it’s Buddhist heritage and ancient architecture. Then it’s back to Yangon, the former capital of modern Myanmar,  and friends discuss what it’s like to be part of a LGBTQ community in one of the most militaristic and strict countries in the world.  \r\n\r\nEpisode 106: Puerto Rico: “Island of Enchantment” (WT)\r\nEpisode 107 - Richmond, Rassawek and Yogaville, Virginia: \r\nEpisode 108 - Chiang Mai, Thailand: “Free Burma Rangers”",

      "ProgramSummary": "Emmy-nominated television series THE GOOD ROAD looks at the messy business of global charity. Hosts Earl Bridges and Craig Martin--longtime philanthropy veterans, globetrotters and best friends--trek around the world to meet people who are making a difference in their communities. In Season Three, they meet people who are dealing with PTSD, racism, climate change, overfishing, plastic pollution and civilian space travel.  Their travels take them to places close to home such as Nashville, Florida's Space Coast, Utah, the James River in Virginia, as well as foreign destinations such as Mexico and the Netherlands. Wherever they go, they discover inspiring change-makers, and the limitless power of good.  Stories of people in need are mingled with stories of people helping out on the frontlines of The Good Road. \r\n\r\nEPISODES;\r\n\r\nNashville, Tennessee\r\nMusic City is not just a place to hang out, drink good craft beer and hear original music, there are a lot of changemakers in the city.  Craig and Earl explore all of it and have great conversations with residents like Janet Ivey of the children's PBS show Janet's Planet.  Janet was featured on CNN during the Mars landing in 2021.\r\n\r\nSpace Coast\r\nSpace Perspective founders Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum are designing and building an environmentally friendly stratospheric balloon to take civilians up to the outer atmosphere.  Ultimately, the Good Road plans to be the first travel show in space.  In the meantime we talk with Jane and Tabor and a musician and space advocate, Mary Liz Bender, of the band Twin Limb. \r\n\r\nUttrecht, Netherlands, Greenland\r\nThe global issue of climate change has some of the best minds working on solutions, many of those are in Europe. We travel to Utrecht, Netherlands to talk with\r\nLeading Senior Traffic Engineer Bas Govers of the organization Excellent Cities. And then we travel to Greenland where the impact of climate change is most obvious.\r\n\r\nJames River, Virginia\r\nRiver advocates Laney Jameson Price lead The Good Road team to special spots along the James River that they sing about and highlight in their environmental activism.  And, James River Association CEO Bill Street takes the team on a trip on the James to follow the work of Research Scientist Matthew Balazik as they work together to try and repopulate the once nearly extinct Atlantic Sturgeon.\r\n\r\nCareyes and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico\r\nFinal Cycles Executive Director Norman Vaux II discusses plastic waste and the damage caused to the environment.  Final Cycles is working to solve the global plastic pollution problem through education, community Involvement and technology. Along the way, Norman, Craig and Earl eat the great food and drink which is famous in this region of Mexico.\r\n\r\nCharleston, South Carolina\r\nThe Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim synagogue was founded in 1749 is one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the United States.  A walk through the synagogue with worshiper Anita Rosenberg reveals the impact that the congregation has had over the years in support of the city. The Good Road also ventures out to the country to watch Chef Marcus Middleton prepare traditional Gullah cuisine alongside his famed knife maker brother Quintin Middleton, founder and creator of Middleton Knives. Quintin's knives are preferred by some of the world's top chefs.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico\r\nPerspectives from Puerto Rican activists Tito Kayak and performer La Bruja gives a deeper understanding of what it means to be Puerto Rican.  The Good Road also travels to Loiza to meet up with artist Samuel Lind.  Loiza is internationally known for its former slave community and spawning musical genres like Bomba, Plena and the Vejigante (carnival) performers.  Samuel expresses each through his art.\r\n\r\nUtah\r\nStacy Bare is a combat veteran having served in battle in places like Iraq.  After returning from the war he struggled and at one point his PTSD led him to a moment where he was at the brink of taking his own life.  Fortunately, he called a friend who said to put it off and go rock climbing with him in Utah. That led to an epiphany that the outdoors are conducive for healing and he wound up starting an organization called Adventure Not War where he led other combat veterans to places like Afghanistan to ski and interact, in peace, with the local residents.  He now has Happy Grizzly Adventures and will be leading expeditions where capture his latest adventures and tell his story.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "An innovative, inspiring documentary series about two best friends who travel the world meeting philanthropists and change-makers, who have dedicated their lives to addressing global humanitarian issues. In season 4, hosts Earl Bridges and Craig Martin explore important issues and meet people making a difference in Iraq, the US Virgin Islands, New York City, Charleston and Nashville.\r\n\r\nEpisode 401 - New York City, NY: \r\n2023 is an exciting year for New York City and Earl Bridges and Craig Martin capture some of the highlights like the 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop.  Music and the arts have always been a major part of progressing society forward and New York City has often set the pace for that progress.  Topics like LGBTQ rights, racial and ethnic equity and in settings like the Theater for the New City and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe (some of which are also celebrating 50 years of community influence).\r\n\r\nEpisode 402 - US Virgin Islands: \r\nThe US Virgin Islands were formerly a colony of Denmark and were sold to the United States in 1917 for military reasons.  Each of the 3 islands; St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix has its own identity and historic development by the US.  The Good Road team explores some of the nuisances between the islands with a focus on identity, sustainability and education.  As the only HBCU in the Caribbean, the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) is providing educational opportunities for marginalized communities on both the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix.\r\n\r\nEpisode 403 - Mosul, Iraq: \r\n\"Conflict never begins with things we agree on.\" This statement from Hardwired Global is profound and is part of what compels Craig Martin and Earl Bridges to venture into a country with a history of war and conflict, Iraq.  Most Americans think they know most things about Iraq largely from reporting during eight years of conflict ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“in-country.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  But, there is so much more to Iraq than conflict and the team from Hardwired Global takes The Good Road team into Mosul to discover what itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s like to bring unity through education.  Sometimes this is done by helping the children of Kurdish Christians and the children of extremist Islamic groups understand each other by participating in games and activities ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ together.\r\n\r\nEpisode 404 - Charleston, SC: \r\nIf you think you know everything about the city of Charleston, South Carolina you might have missed some of the communities that have made the city what it is today.  Earl Bridges shares his city with Craig Martin as they explore the Jewish community as represented by the people of the Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim (KKBE) synagogue in downtown Charleston.  Founded in 1749 the KKBE is known to be the oldest Reform Jewish Synagogue in the United States.  In this episode The Good Road team also gets introduced to members of the LGBTQ  community which has had a huge influence in CharlestonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s arts and culture scene.  And, activists within the gay community have pushed for recognition of that influence.\r\n\r\nEpisode 405 - Shelbyville and Nashville, TN: \r\nThe Good Road team drives outside of Nashville, Tennessee to meet up with Fawn Weaver who is the founder and CEO of the Uncle Nearest Whisky Distillery in Shelbyville, TN.  Not only is Fawn the only female black owner of a major whiskey distillery, she is joined by her friend and awarded whiskey blender, Victoria Eady Butler.  Victoria is a descendant of the distilleryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s namesake Nearest Green aka. Uncle Nearest. As black women, Fawn and Victoria are breaking stereotypes in the very male dominated business of spirits and the production and distribution of high quality whiskey.  As a business, they also involve themselves heavily in the community and in causes that help promote black and female owned businesses across the US. \r\n\r\nEpisode 406 - New York City, NY: \r\nThe image of who visits and uses food provided by food banks across the US is often skewed by TV and Film and can be completely inaccurate.  Many of the people who are sustained and survive in our communities on food provided philanthropically are hard working people who have jobs and work each and every day to support their families.  The realities of these communities are highlighted in New York City by journalists from the massively impactful Food Bank NYC.  Meet working class people (many immigrants) who have struggled to survive in one of the wealthiest cities in the world in this episode of The Good Road.\r\n\r\nEpisode 407 - Nashville, TN: \r\nAcross the United States there is an underground and yet very visible criminal industry we know as human sexual trafficking.  Like many issues in America, this problem is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“hidden in plain sight.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  The victims of this horrible criminal industry have found new hope in survivor houses like Thistle Farms in Nashville, Tennessee.  Founder & President Becca Stevens is passionate about helping these women and men in part because early in life she was also a victim.  Thistle Farms treats everyone who visits as part of a community that finds value in everyone.  And, they provide in-house work for the survivors of human trafficking.  Craig and Earl sit down with Becca and learn what makes her the iconic figure she is in Nashville and across the country.\r\n\r\nEpisode 408 - St. Croix: \r\nSt. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands is tightly connected to the US mainland politically and socially.  But, for many reasons (including geographical), the island of St. Croix is truly an ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“islandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â among the islands of the USVI.  Some of the major problems on St. Croix ties back to inequities in influence with the broader USVI.  The center of commerce on St. Croix is in Christiansted while the west coast city of Frederiksted is the heart of black Cruzan culture.  Negative impacts on the environment from a major refinery near Frederiksted combined with a serious lack of adequate education and access to healthy food has made St. Croix vulnerable.  The RT Park in St. Croix located across from the UVI St. Croix campus is working to turn vulnerabilities into strengths.  ",

But less well-known is the story of her missing millions. When Grace tragically died, she appeared to have assets of just $10,000 and a ramshackle cottage in Ireland. \r\n\r\nThis film reveals Grace’s privileged financial upbringing & the difficult relationship with her father; her struggle for self-sufficiency in New York where modelling funded her true love: acting. This is a story about a woman with a head for business but who was exposed to sexual double standards and the gender pay gap. As a Princess Grace had to pay her own dowry only to find herself trapped in a gilded cage - worth millions to Monaco yet earning little for herself. And since her death, the Grace Kelly name and image continues to generate millions… but who benefits? A revealing look at the missing millions of a global icon.",

Deadly clashes ensue between man and beast, as they fight over land that farmers have set aside for crops; a fight which the elephants will surely lose.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The story of humble baker Thomas Farriner and his fabled involvement in The Great Fire of London.. \r\n \r\nAndrew Buchan (Broadchurch, Garrow’s Law, Nowhere Boy) plays the role of Thomas in the 4 x 45 minute drama.\r\n \r\nInspired by the historical events of 1666 and with the decadent backdrop of King Charles II’s court, The Great Fire focuses on the circumstances which led to the catastrophic fire, Thomas Farriner’s family life at the bakery in Pudding Lane, the playboy King’s extravagant lifestyle, and Farriner’s complex relationship with his fictional sister in law, Sarah played by Rose Leslie (Utopia, Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey). Jack Huston (American Hustle, Boardwalk Empire, Parade’s End) plays the role of King Charles II and Diarist Samuel Pepys, a close confidante of the King who dared to tell him “he was consumed by the pursuit of pleasure”, is portrayed by Daniel Mays (Mrs Biggs, Treasure Island, Public Enemies). Pepys wife Elizabeth is played by Perdita Weeks (The Invisible Woman, Flight of the Storks).  Also starring is Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Dracula, Mr Selfridge, World Without End) as the King’s brother, James Duke of York, Andrew Tiernan (Ripper Street, Foyle’s War, Prisoner’s Wives) as prisoner Vincent, a forgotten soul languishing in Newgate prison, and Antonia Clarke (Lightfields, A Mother’s Son) as Frances Stewart who famously captured the King’s heart.  Other key roles include Lord Denton, an emissary of the King’s, played by Charles Dance (Game of Thrones, Secret State, Strike Back) whilst the Duke of Hanford, the most powerful Catholic nobleman in the land is played by David Schofield (Da Vinci’s Demons, Land Girls, The Shadow Line) and Sonya Cassidy (Vera, The Paradise, Endeavour) stars as The Queen.  \r\n \r\nThe Great Fire unfolds over four consecutive days as the fire indiscriminately takes hold of the city and the people desperately attempt to overcome the flames.  The episodes capture the most prosperous city of its age as fire rages and engulfs dwellings and businesses like the bakery on Pudding Lane.  Terrified and bewildered, the people are thrown into chaos, and with each day they become increasingly desperate to seek safety away from the city.    \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nEpisode one\r\n \r\nIt’s the summer of 1666. Thomas Farriner is the King’s baker, supplying bread and biscuit for the Navy, who are currently at war. A widower and single-father, Thomas works alongside his daughters Mary and Hannah, with a little help from his sister-in-law, Sarah Farriner, in his Pudding Lane bakery.  \r\nTimes are hard and Sarah’s wayward husband (and Thomas’ brother) has been missing at sea for many months. Although she’s unable to move on, there’s no denying the crackle between Thomas and Sarah as she departs to prepare for the return of her employer, the Duke of Hanford.  \r\nThomas heads off with the Navy delivery and when he arrives at the Navy yards, it quickly becomes clear he’s not going to be paid for all the work he’s done. Thomas discusses his lack of payment with Navy official Samuel Pepys and is dismayed to learn there is no hope of payment due to the expense of the war. However, Pepys is able to help Thomas in another way and he sends him away with a letter confirming the fate of Will Farriner.\r\n \r\nAcross the city in the palace of Whitehall, the King is at a stately dance, enjoying his many spoils and women in full view of his wife, the Queen. Amidst the reverie a terrifying assassination attempt is foiled by the King’s Intelligence Officer, Lord Denton. Under interrogation, the assassin reveals he’s a Catholic fanatic and a former employee of Sarah’s boss, the Duke of Hanford, who Denton has under surveillance. Is there some kind of larger Catholic plot in the works? The King registers concern but surprisingly his brother, James Duke of York, stands up for Hanford. \r\n \r\nSamuel Pepys enjoy a game of Pall Mall with the King but returns home to find his wife Elizabeth with her dance teacher. Jealous and hurt, he slips away to visit a prostitute. \r\n \r\nAt the bakery, a troubled Thomas leaves his daughter Hannah in charge and heads to his sister-in-law with a heavy heart. Meanwhile, Sarah is visited by a ‘Mr Wickes’, supposedly a kindly man from church, but who reveals himself to be Lord Denton. He asks that she act as an informant on her employer, Hanford. And gives her a couple of hours to decide. Seeing Denton from afar, Thomas assumes Sarah is courting the so-called ‘Mr Wickes’ and decides against delivering her the letter from Pepys. \r\n \r\nThomas returns home to Pudding Lane to find the bakery ablaze and his two daughters asleep upstairs, blissfully unaware of the fire below. Thomas scrabbles to get the girls out, only just escaping the flames by climbing across the roof, before his home is completely consumed. He sends the girls to Sarah’s lodgings while he attempts to contain the fire. But upon receiving them, Sarah goes to look for Thomas. Out on the street, she is snatched by Denton’s men and thrown in the back of a prison carriage…\r\n\r\nEpisode two\r\n \r\nThe fire is gaining strength. Thomas bursts into sister-in-law Sarah Farriner’s lodgings to wake his family and lead them to safety. But Sarah is nowhere to be seen and their shouts for her in the street yield nothing. Thomas leads them through the crowds to the Thames. But they have no luck escaping by river, so instead make their way north towards Moorfields. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, Sarah is being held in a private cell at Newgate Prison while Denton interrogates the Duke of Hanford’s Footman, Carter. Denton’s piecing together a theory about Hanford’s mysterious Spanish guest and believes a box the Spaniard keeps with him at all times contains the keys to a Catholic plot against the King. Soon it’s Sarah’s turn to be interrogated and when she refuses to cooperate, Denton throws her in Newgate’s general cell, crawling with crazed criminals. To her surprise she’s protected by Newgate’s most formidable criminal, Vincent. \r\n \r\nWhile she fights for her life, Sarah’s son David wanders the burning streets alone, searching for his mother. When he sees ‘Mr Wickes’, he thinks he’s found a friendly face – unaware that Wickes is simply one of many masks for Lord Denton. \r\n \r\nPepys brings news of the fire’s spread to the King at the Palace of Whitehall and the subject is discussed at Council. While Hyde and Lord Ashley argue against it, encouraged by James and the Queen, the King follows Pepys’ advice to survey the damage for himself from the safety of the river. From this vantage point, the King is shocked into action, ordering his advisors to tear down buildings to create fire-breaks and to compensate the public for damage. But despite Pepys delivering this message to the Mayor himself, Hyde and Ashley undercut him by rescinding the promise to pay compensation. \r\n \r\nElizabeth Pepys receives a visit from Mr Bagwell, the husband of the prostitute her husband has been visiting.  He is looking for work but makes it clear how Pepys knows his wife. Elizabeth is dismayed. Meanwhile, Sarah is taken back into interrogation with Denton, and remains strong until she sees he has captured David. \r\n \r\nUnder great duress, Sarah agrees to retrieve the mysterious box from Catholic Romero’s chamber in Hanford’s house. Across the city, Hanford and Romero are meeting with someone in secret, clearly plotting something with a figure in the shadows, revealed to be the King’s own brother – James, the Duke of York. \r\n \r\nAt Moorefields Thomas tells Hannah to look after her sister because he must find Sarah and David. Exhausted and careworn, Thomas journeys back into the burning city.\r\n\r\nEpisode three\r\n \r\nThomas returns to the city in search of Sarah to see the fire spreading with alarming speed across the capital. In Whitehall the King’s angry to learn his orders to create fire-breaks have been ignored by his advisors. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, Sarah stealthily sneaks back into Hanford’s house and retrieves the mysterious box from Señor Romero’s room. Heading back out to meet with Denton, and thinking she’s home free, she comes face-to-face with Thomas. Under Denton’s watchful eye she tries to warn him away, quietly begging him to retrieve David from Newgate. She leaves Thomas confused and hurt. \r\n \r\nWhen Sarah delivers the box to Denton, he’s disappointed – it merely contains letters from the King’s mother to her Priest. He’s convinced it’s the wrong box and sends her back to retrieve the correct one. This time, when she enters Romero’s room, he and Hanford catch her in the act. Sarah begs for mercy, explaining Denton coerced her into this act – that he has her son. \r\n \r\nDenton reads the letters from the box and realises James is the mastermind behind an assassination of his brother by Señor Romero. He marches on the Duke’s house only to see Sarah escaping, and – when they become embroiled in a tussle – stabs Hanford to death. \r\n \r\nAt Newgate, the fire is upon them and Thomas manages to free David and the other prisoners. Thomas asks Vincent to escort David to Moorfields, so he can save Sarah.\r\n \r\nDenton is on the move towards the palace, where he interrupts a meeting between the King, Romero and James, and levels his accusation of treason against them. James denies there is any such assassination plot and instead reveals he was orchestrating a move to convert the King to Catholicism – Romero is merely a priest. Denton drags Romero away for interrogation, now fixated on Sarah’s involvement in a Catholic conspiracy. He strangles the Spaniard to death before he can clear her name. \r\n \r\nWhen the King and his brother James are alone, James attests that he is only guilty of trying to make his brother a better king. He gives his brother an ultimatum: serve your people on the streets fighting this fire or he will. But it is James who rides out of the palace to fight the fire. \r\n \r\nElizabeth confronts Pepys about his infidelity, in the wake of Mr Bagwell’s visit to their home, but Pepys pleads ignorance. In retaliation Elizabeth visits Alfredo her dance teacher, but when things get passionate she realises she cannot consummate an affair. Meanwhile, Thomas finally finds Sarah on the streets, hiding from Denton’s men. Together they find shelter. She is overwhelmed to hear that David is safe. And tells Thomas she knows of her husbands death. The pair fall passionately into each other’s arms.  \r\nEPISODE FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n Thomas guiltily reveals that Sarah’s husband Will is not dead as she suspected. He is in fact alive having deserted to the colonies, leaving his family alone and penniless. Sarah’s shock turns to anger at Thomas. And it’s with a shadow hanging over them that they return to Moorfields. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, the King has retreated to drinking with his mistress when the Queen approaches to inform him James’ efforts are failing. It’s clear the King has no faith in himself anymore but the Queen reminds him of the man he was when they met. \r\n \r\nThomas and Sarah’s emotional reunion with their children is at once threatened by Denton’s men. As they’re preparing to leave, Hannah accidentally lets slip to David that his father is alive. Moments later there’s panic as Thomas and Sarah realise David has run off to the Navy yards to seek the truth about his father, and that Hannah has gone with him. \r\n \r\nThe streets are descending into chaos and a rabble, joined by Mr Bagwell, lynch the dance teacher Alfredo. This is witnessed by Pepys and Elizabeth, the shocking events overriding their marital problems. Meanwhile, an anxious King rides out to join an exhausted James on the streets, ordering that they starve the fire by using the gunpowder from the Tower to create fire-breaks. When the people protest, the King climbs off his horse and urges their help eye-to-eye. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, Sarah, Thomas and Mary, are back in the city in pursuit of Hannah and David. They take refuge from Denton’s men in a friendly Ropemaker’s house, but to their dismay are turned over to Denton’s men. Thomas escapes with Mary as Sarah is dragged away. \r\n \r\nOn the streets, the King’s gunpowder strategy begins to work so he makes peace with James and returns to the palace. Pepys’ wife opens the door to see children on the doorstep – David and Hannah Farriner. When Pepys returns home he’s shocked to see the ‘criminal’ family his wife is harbouring. Thomas and Mary arrive and Thomas implores Pepys to help give him an audience with the King. \r\n \r\nSarah stands before the King, accused of treason, with Denton doing everything in his power to convince the King she’s guilty. Pepys and Thomas enter the court, Pepys pleading with the King to see the truth. Thomas confesses that he alone is responsible for the fire and that it is all an accident. Denton cleverly manipulates the King into believing his people will never accept such a weak reason – they want a sacrifice! \r\n \r\nThe King rides out to his people and as Sarah is readied for her execution Thomas confesses his love for her. When the King inspects the devastation he realises that scapegoats will not aid in rebuilding the city. He gives a rousing address. Fear is their enemy. There will be no more deaths because of this fire. Sarah is released and she, Thomas and their family return to where it all started, the remains of the bakery on Pudding Lane, to rebuild and start afresh.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week42/great-fire\r\n ",

Bikers and hikers get a personal, up-close look as the producers identify 21 key landmarks on the trail, devoting time to spotlight each stop's significance, history, and appeal. Segments include a rare look at the under workings of Pittsburgh's majestic Point Park fountain, the towering Salisbury Viaduct, the engineering marvel of the Big Savage Tunnel, the Mason and Dixon Line monument, a wistful tour of Dead Man's Hollow, the Darr Mine Disaster memorial, and much more. This 2022 program is a follow-up to the 2019 APT/WQED documentary \"The Great Ride\" which gave viewers a beautiful and more sweeping overview of the GAP and the C&O Canal Towpath trails that link Pittsburgh and Washington, DC.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Greening of the Bronx: An Urban Garden Tale is a film about South Bronx black and brown environmentalists fighting the racist public policies that have plagued their community.  The South Bronx, like many urban communities, has a widely disproportionate number of waste facilities including waste transfer stations, sewage sludge treatment plants, as well as a number of power plants and prisons. Four prisons have been built in the Bronx with a fifth being planned. Public policy has saddled these residents with poor health outcomes - the area has become a food desert, with air and water toxicity, and a school system that serves more as a school-to-prison pipeline than to successful lives.\r\n\r\nThe Greening of the Bronx: An Urban Garden Tale is an ensemble piece, a community portrait that follows three trainees and their team leaders/trainers at Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx). But they are not an island, they are part of the larger grassroots activism in the Bronx fighting on many fronts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from removal of the Sheridan Expressway, to closing prisons, to creating affordable housing, to expanding parks by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCappingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â the Cross Bronx Expressway with parks to reduce the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œasthma alleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â corridors in the Bronx - Bronx activists are fighting and winning. Each teacher at Sustainable South Bronx is an activist, and each sees the power of change in the microcosm that is the Bronx ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one person at a time, to the macrocosm of the Bronx ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ social inequality and environmental injustice. Too often urban communities are painted in the media as having no agency for their own change and are left out of the processes and public policy decisions that determine the future of their community. Sustainable South Bronx rebuffs that stereotype and offers solutions. It shows a community fighting for itself at every level - through the love they have for one another, the love for the people who enter their doors, the love of their community - and succeeding. We are at a critical juncture in deciding what our climate solutions will be. Urban communities will be central to these solutions. The environmental activists of the Bronx are carving a path towards those solutions that look at not only how one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â urban communities, but the people within that community also.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Gregorian: Pure Chants In Concert includes a stunning blend of traditional chants and contemporary music compiled from the exquisitely produced Gregorian concert DVDs from the last years. Music selections represent Pure Chants, the new Gregorian CD set of uplifting, meaningful songs.  This music is also featured in the upcoming Pure Chants Tour and generous station ticket offer, preliminary details below. \r\n\r\nThis high-quality production features spectacular lighting and sound, samples in set list below.  The songs were all recorded in front of a live audience. At the top of each segment, Ms. Brightman will offer insight into song choices and production. \r\n\r\nGregorian producer Frank Peterson, keenly aware of the world traumas we have all experienced during the last few years, is using the benefits of traditional Gregorian music to bring audiences back to life.   There are scientific studies that show Gregorian music creates calm and serenity.  Gregorian chants have been sung for 1200 years.  Peterson and Gregorian created a more contemporary version of the music that is attractive to all audiences because of the power and emotion of the music and the atmospheric quality it creates.  Gregorian pours new meaning into lyrics that touch the soul. This genre of music - as history proves – that does not go out of style.  Gregorian modernizes it with their song selections and production. \r\n\r\nThe special and tour include singers Amelia Brightman, whom is clearly the sister of Sarah as evidenced by her pure soprano voice and beauty, and Narcis, a rare and true contra-tenor.

      "ProgramSummary": "\"Groundworks\" profiles four of the California Native co-creators of the Groundworks projecta collaborative performance on Alcatraz Island on San Franciscos first official Indigenous Peoples Day in October 2018. While weaving together these artists stories and their contemporary ways of sharing traditional knowledge, the \"Groundworks\" documentary considers issues of land management, water rights, and food securityconcerns for all Americans, especially in an age of climate change. These issues are particularly acute in Indigenous communities that have called these lands home for millennia, and who remain resilient despite centuries of colonization and marginalization. We travel from traditional acorn gathering spots to the studios where the Groundworks performance was rehearsed before being shared after dawn, 50 years after Indians of All Tribes occupied Alcatraz.",

      "ProgramSummary": "Shot entirely in Sonoma County, the feature-length documentary \"Harvest\" reveals the blood, sweat and tears that go into every bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nThere is no swirling, no sniffing, no sipping or quaffing. This is all about back-breaking manual labor and night picks at 2 a.m. with only tiny headlamps.\r\n\r\nOver the course of three months during Harvest 2011, the film follows five family wineries“ Robledo, Rafanelli, Foppiano, Harvest Moon and Robert Hunter, along with an amateur home winemaker and an extremely rare all-female picking crew“ made up of women from Michoacan and Oaxaca, Mexico.\r\n\r\nNot interested in massive corporate wineries, director John Beck instead casts his intimate DSLR lens on salt-of-the-earth, tight-knit family farmers and field workers who are the backbone of the wine industry, reavealing a glimpse of the American grape harvest that has never before been captured on film.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we meet Reynaldo Robledo, the first migrant worker to own his own winery. There's Wayne Rogers, who loses 80 percent of his zinfandel crop to wild pigs. In his early 70s, Rudy Rodriquez has devoted more than half his life to Robert Hunter Winery. The women pickers share their border-crossing stories, showing how much they sacrificed just to get to Sonoma County, much less do a job that most Americans would never consider.\r\n\r\nThe narrative builds to a third act of untimely rainstorms and widespread grape rot - what everyone in the film will later agree is the worst harvest in their lifetimes. This is the story behind the wine you drink. ",

Set against the stunning backdrop of country Australia, The Healing is an inspiring journey of recovery that immerses us in the emotional drama of two very different worlds.\r\nThe stakes are literally life and death for the horses and humans participating in the Thoroughbred and Veteran Welfare Alliance’s 5-day program. All were highly trained, regimented and of great service and value to their employers, but were then discarded and left to fend for themselves. Their previous skills have rendered them useless in the “real world,” and they now face uncertain futures.\r\nThe two vulnerable groups are brought together by professional horseman Scott Brodie, whose unique system of retraining teaches both horses and humans new skills that build trust, patience and confidence. In an extraordinary mutual-healing, the horses are retrained for second careers as equestrian, therapy or recreational horses. The veterans regain their pride and focus, return to work and repair relationships with family and friends.\r\nThe Healing will create enormous interest in the Alliance’s ground-breaking program, which can revolutionise the way the Defence Force and Racing Industry responds to the crisis afflicting veterans and ex-racehorses. Urgent change is needed and we need to act now.",

Her life and career are well documented, from her work in Hollywood to her marriage to Prince Rainier and her tragic death in a car accident in 1982.\r\nBut do we know the inside story? Who really was Grace Kelly?\r\nThanks to an exclusive agreement with the Principality of Monaco, this documentary will tell Grace’s life story as it’s never been told before, through the eyes of those close to her and who loved her, including her family – notably Prince Albert of Monaco –, and friends.\r\nFor the first time, the Grimaldi family has given access to its private archives, much of which has never been made public before, and agreed to talk us through this intimate material. This comprises many films shot in 8mm, 16mm and super-8 by Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier themselves, which reveal a mother who is quite different to the official image: Free, vibrant, surrounded by her children and participating in family life. A look back on an icon with a tragic destiny.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Herriot Way walk is a 52-mile, circular walk that runs through some of the best scenery in the Yorkshire Dales, featuring many of the places associated with \"All Creatures Great and Small\" author James Herriot. It is typically walked over four days in clockwise fashion, starting and finishing in Aysgarth with overnight stops in Hawes, Keld and Reeth. The walk is named after James Herriot, the fictional name of real-life veterinary surgeon Alf Wright, who lived and worked in the Dales for many years and took walking holidays with his son. Along its length the Herriot Way roams across beautiful valleys, high, open fells and rolling, heather-clad moorland. The route explores one of the highest points in Yorkshire Dales, visits historic monuments and passes through a barren industrial wilderness laid bare through lead mining.\r\n\r\nThe program features interviews with Alf Wight’s son, explores the filming locations for the \"All Creatures Great and Small\" series, and shares stories of the land which so inspired the works of James Herriot.",

Gaspar was adopted by an officer in charge of the repression, while Pedro flees from a home for minors, growing up on the streets of the city of Valparaiso. Antonio, now called Gaspar, without knowing that he was adopted, grew up in the Sanfuentes family surrounded by privileges that money allows. While Pedro has become one of the most respected criminals on the streets, and has promised himself to find his younger brother and avenge the death of his parents. Twenty five years later, they meet again without knowing that they are brothers. Gaspar, converted into a policeman, was sent to the port to fight a gang of smugglers and criminals, led by Pedro. Both will become great enemies, especially when they fall in love with the same woman. All this, in a context of political upheaval and international intrigue.",

Based on the original recordings of this meeting—used to produce the mythical book Hitchcock/Truffaut—this film illustrates the greatest cinema lesson of all time and plummets us into the world of the creator of Psycho, The Birds, and Vertigo. Hitchcock’s incredibly modern art is elucidated and explained by today’s leading filmmakers: Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, Arnaud Desplechin, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Wes Anderson, James Gray, Olivier Assayas, Richard Linklater, Peter Bogdanovich and Paul Schrader. \r\n\r\nhttp://cohenmedia.net/films/hitchcock-truffaut",

      "ProgramSummary": "In 1931, the Olympics were awarded to Berlin. However the Germany hosting the event five years later would be a very different place. Adolf Hitler had come to power in the meantime and the Nazis eagerly grasped the propaganda opportunity the Olympics represented. The scale of the 1936 Games would amaze the world and begin Olympic traditions that remain to this day. Although some at the time tried to organise boycotts, all too few saw the rotting truth behind the slick façade. Hitler’s Olympics tells the complete story of the Berlin games – the early plans, the Nazi takeover, the purge of Jews from German athletics and the grand spectacle itself.  The documentary features exclusive interviews with 101 year old Margaret Lambert – the top German high jumper excluded from the games because she was Jewish and Captain Eric “Winkle” Brown who recalls visiting the games as a 17 year old and watching Jesse Owens, the fastest man on earth whose achievements so infuriated Hitler.

      "ProgramSummary": "  Hitler's Space Rocket  juggles the narratives of three protagonists,     Germany, England and the United States,  at a crucial time in WW2. \r\nFrom Germany, we follow Wernher von Braun, a rocket scientist who dreams of getting a man into space,  but this same ambition leads him to developing the deadly V2. Though von Braun may not have intended to create a weapon initially, his research is now in the hands of the Nazi Party and the SS,   and his rockets are being used to terrorize London and other parts of Europe. These devastating attacks could change the outcome of the war .\r\nMeanwhile in London, Reginald Victor Jones a scientific analyst at top-secret MI6 must work against the clock to find a way to battle the menacing rockets that are battering his city. Jones, with his reputation as Churchill’s ‘wizard boy’, will need more than magic to beat the V2. He crafts a clever plan, but for this plan to work he’ll need to trust a double-agent, one who could switch back to the Nazi side at any moment. With the number of V2 casualties in London increasing by the day, there’s no time for Jones to hesitate…\r\nFinally, the Americans, who with the end of the war almost within their. grasp,  have  set their sights  on what will happen to this revolutionary technology when the Nazis have finally been defeated. The V2 is the first ballistic missile that the world has ever seen.   James Hamill is a US soldier who has been sent to hunt for the V2 and bring the technology back to his country. To accomplish this,  Hamill needs to capture the German scientists headed by von Braun and bring them to America as a part of Operation Paperclip. The race for the rocket designs is on – but will Hamill get what he needs before the Russians get it first?",

      "ProgramSummary": "I received a phone call one day from a friend who works for the FBI. She had clicked on a link to a film project I was working on about what happens when girls in rural villages in India are educated. One of the outcomes is less susceptibility to human trafficking. My friend said, You dont have to go to India to document how children are caught in the sex trades. It happens right here. We need you to come home and educate people here in the United States because they just dont know how huge this problem is. %250D\r\nAt first I said a firm no. This was way beyond what I believed we could handle, but they kept telling me stories about how serious the problem was, and finally I called my co-producer and he said YES, lets do it. So we began with the help of our FBI friends to find survivors of child sex trafficking. In this film youll meet Misty, Catalleya, David (Yes, boys are trafficked too.), and Greg, whose powerful stories of survival are almost unbearable to hear. Through them we hope to raise awareness about child sex trafficking for everyone we can reach. We also wanted to focus on solutions by portraying the tremendous efforts being made by dedicated individuals to resolve the problem. And most importantly, youll find out how everyone, not only the experts, can help in so many ways.%250D\r\nBut you can also help. We are a non-profit media company that believes in serving others. This film was produced as a public service to address an important social issue, and you can be part of the solution if you air it! We also offer our film to you as a gift for fund raising. The bottom line is: we need people to see this film so they might demand changes in our legislation. When the people get angry, they act.",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Horse Relative is a new hour-long documentary about the historic art of horse regalia and how it is being revived and reinterpreted by Dakota communities for a new generation. \r\nThe program is produced by Pioneer PBS based in Granite Falls, Minnesota..\r\n\r\nArtists James Star Comes Out and Keith Braveheart of the Oglala Lakota tribe of South Dakota collaborated with Pioneer PBS and Dakota Wicohan of Morton to create this documentary which shares stories of Native lives with the sacred horse and the centuries-old tradition of dressing horses for ceremonies and celebrations.\r\n\r\nStar Comes Out has made a commitment to transferring knowledge about horse regalia to tribal youth throughout the Upper Midwest. Videographer Issac Larsen collaborated with Pioneer PBS videographers Kristofor Gieske, Ben Dempcy and Dylan Curfman to capture the colorful images from events and interviews that are featured in the story. Pioneer PBS producer Dana Conroy worked closely with Star Comes Out and Braveheart to guide the development of the documentary which is edited by Kevin Russell.\r\n\r\nSeveral Native Americans from both Minnesota and the Dakotas are interviewed in the film, including Eileen O'Keefe, executive director of Dakota Wicohan -- who invited Star Comes Out to share his art form with the community. The documentary is a story of migration following the difficult path Native people and their horse relatives traversed as foreigners settled the surrounding lands and how the Dakota people of Minnesota are working to keep their cultural identity thriving.  \r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "HOT FLASH HAVOC is the most provocative and revealing film ever made about menopause. For the first time this film sets the record straight about the Women's Health Initiative study released in 2002, which misrepresented that the hormonal replacement therapy being used by millions of women to treat the symptoms of menopause could actually increase the risk of heart attacks and cancer. This misinformation caused confusion, hysteria, and fear among women as well as healthcare providers, endangering the health and well being of millions of women, many of whom flushed their hormones down the toilet. This film not only sheds insightful light on the confusion stemming from a decade of misguided facts, but conveys poignant personal stories shared by real women and in-depth interviews with the world's most noted experts. HOT FLASH HAVOC provides compelling information about menopause that will empower women for the \"Second Act\" of their lives. Find out why \"THE HEAT IS ON\" about: •Understanding Perimenopause, Menopause, & Postmenopause •Understanding Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone. •Being Sexual & Having Orgasms into Your 80's •Sex Drive vs. Loss of Libido •Vaginal Pleasure vs. Vaginal Dryness •Alert Mind & Memory vs. Dementia •Maintenance of Memory & Brain Function •Bone Health vs. Osteoporosis •Heart Health vs. Heart Attacks & Strokes •Positive Outlook & Moods vs. Depression & Mood Swings •Restful Sleep vs. Sleeplessness & Fatigue •Skin Rejuvenation vs. Dry Skin •Vitality & Energy vs. Fatigue & Weight Gain •Keeping Membranes Moist: Eyes, Nose, Mouth, & Vagina •Healthy Bladder Functions vs. Incontinence •Healthy Hair vs Hair Loss •Healthy Joints vs Joint Pain •Muscle Strength vs. Loss of Muscle Tone \r\nFrom:  DVD desription on Amazon",

      "ProgramSummary": "At the age of sixteen, Edith Eger was sent to Auschwitz. Hours after her parents were killed, Nazi officer Dr. Josef Mengele, forced Edie to dance for his amusement and her survival. Edie was pulled from a pile of corpses when the American troops liberated the camps in 1945.\r\n\r\nEdie spent decades struggling with flashbacks and survivor's guilt, determined to stay silent and hide from the past. Thirty-five years after the war ended, she returned to Auschwitz and was finally able to fully heal and forgive the one person she'd been unable to forgive--herself.\r\n\r\nEdie weaves her remarkable personal journey with the moving stories of those she has helped heal. She explores how we can be imprisoned in our own minds and shows us how to find the key to freedom. The Choice is a life-changing book that will provide hope and comfort to generations of readers.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "The Daisy Jopling Band performs an eclectic fusion of classical, rock and world music, blending traditional orchestral music aesthetics with a wide array of contemporary musical styles. Our Illuminance film is a Musical Salute to the Magic of Bannerman Castle. \r\n\r\nFrom September 30 to October 4, 2020, the Daisy Jopling Music Mentorship Foundation collaborated with the Bannerman Castle Trust to create a series of five concerts on Bannerman Island, a little island in the middle of the Hudson river in NY with no electricity or running water, and the only access being by boat. A miracle was created. The whole crew built a stage on the island, brought all the sound gear needed for a full band performance with seven musicians, and three other student performances on stages around the island, and all the lighting equipment needed for a stunning illumination on the ruined and fantastical Bannerman Castle. The weather was beautiful every single night, and we were grateful to be the only outdoor music ticketed event allowed in the whole of New York State. \r\n\r\nFilmed by Timeline Video, Directed by Diane Cricchio, Edited by Natt McFee\r\nLighting Design by Deke Hazirjian\r\nRecorded and mixed by Leslie Bloome, Bob Biles and Tom Provenzano\r\nCreated and produced by Daisy Jopling\r\nAssociate Producer Laura Giarratano \r\n\r\nThe Daisy Jopling Band\r\nDaisy Jopling – Violin and Vocals\r\nJeff Miller – Piano\r\nMatthew Watanabe – Keyboard\r\nLavondo Thomas – Electric Bass\r\nSimon Fishburn – Drums\r\nMichael Feigenbaum – Percussion\r\nGuest Musicians\r\nSal Lagonia – Trumpet\r\nJoe Brady – Bagpipes\r\nStudent Musicians\r\nAnton Klettner – Violin\r\nJoseph Klettner – Accordion, Acoustic Guitar\r\nRachel Evans, Mentor – Violin and Viola\r\nHolly Paterno – Viola\r\nJosie Rose – Viola, Bagpipes\r\nNico Catalano – Saxophone\r\nDancers\r\nBelle Torres – Mentor and Choreographer\r\nCaitlin Quinn – Dancer\r\nJustin Smithson – Dancer\r\nMaya Lee Cruz – Dancer\r\nVictoria Dominguez – Dancer\r\nLive Sound\r\nTodd Giudice\r\n",

He took crude, knockabout, slapstick comedy and transformed it into an art form with films that have stood the test of time. Terry Jones, comedian, writer and director, best known for being a leading member of Monty Python and long-time fan of silent comedies, offers a personal re-appraisal of the man who changed the face of film comedy.With access to a wealth of home movie material, Terry Jones also looks at the troubled private life of Chaplin: his loves, his politics, and his obsessions. He talks to Chaplin family members and biographers in his quest to get inside the skin of one of the true giants of film and comedy.   \r\nWildpictures.co.uk",

The 10-part series showcases the landscapes, peoples, and natural history of the Americas - from a village of once-impoverished Japanese immigrants in the Amazon to descendants of poor Italians in Chile, from Mayan temples in Guatemala to ancient fortresses in Mexico and the enigmatic apartment buildings of Chaco Canyon, from the frigid, glacier-carved barrens of Alaska, to the timeless villages of the altiplano in Peru and the volcanoes of New Mexico, from venomous snakes in Brazil to Scarlet ibises in Trinidad and friendly whale calves in Baja California, and from a merchant ship in Canada to reed boats of Bolivia. On foot and by raft, boat, ferry, bicycle, horse, and motorcycle, host David Yetman journeys to parts of Cuba mostly unknown to the outside world, the wild mountains of western Argentina, festivals in Columbia, the Great Lakes of the United States, and the labyrinthine canyons of Southeast Utah. Along the way, he meets people from all walks of life - natives and immigrants, islanders and mainlanders, pastoralists and city-dwellers, scientists, and river runners - and hears their stories. David Yetman, longtime host of The Desert Speaks (also distributed through APT Exchange) is a research social scientist at the Southwest Center of the University of Arizona. Yetman is also a nationally known author of numerous books and articles and an accomplished photographer.\r\n\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Season Nine of In the Americas with David Yetman features the Grand Canyon viewed from a raft on the Colorado River that carved it, first from the viewpoint of researchers and advocates for the River, and then from the scientists who study how the river and the canyon formed each other.  From the Canyon we follow the river to its end as its water is diverted on all sides and users scramble for their share of the vital liquid.  After we fly over glaciers in our largest national park in Alaska, we visit the now famous Mexican village of Mata Ortiz, where potters show us their wares and describe how they became famous.  Farther south, two Mexican towns show us their Carnival celebrations, strange, noisy, and wonderful.  To the west we join marine biologists striving to protect the Gulf of California and its bountiful marine resources from poaching and overharvesting.  Brazil's varied population of snakes are the subject of a visit to the Amazon, and how indigenous cultures represent these venomous critters.  To the south, Brazilian researchers house thousands of venomous species and extract their venom to protect human lives and advance cures for disease.  Back in Arizona we learn of Arizona's explosive volcanic past and how new violence could erupt at any time.  \r\n \r\n",

With the help of her cousin Ty and their Grandma Tilly, an eccentric art teacher with friends all over town, the kids go on art quests all around their neighborhood. The cousins learn about art spaces big and small, hear from local makers and get a chance to create something themselves. The Infinite Art Hunt invites elementary school age viewers to join Freddie on a virtual field trip that covers a wide range of artistic mediums and styles, from public art to sculpture gardens, museums to airports and more. Each episode is shot on location at real spaces with real guests, including curators, photographers, educators and artists, and inspires kids to explore art in their own community. With a curriculum based on the PBS Kids Arts Learning Framework, The Infinite Art Hunt will include accompanying lesson plans for each episode, encouraging kids to engage in their own artistic process.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "We don't know how. We don't know when. But death comes to us all. To be human is to wrestle with this truth. \"Into The Night: Darkness and Light\" explores the ways we think about death and about our own deaths in particular. Like its 2018 predecessor, \"Into The Night: Portraits of Life and Death,\" this new film addresses similar themes around the great unanswered question:  How do we live with death inevitably in our sight? To borrow from Dylan Thomas, do we go gently or raging against the night, with equanimity or with anger, with clenched fists or, more commonly, with denial? Or do we see death as something to be fought, or even conquered - a challenge increasingly pursued by some of the brightest scientific minds of our day?  Finally, what are the stories we tell ourselves as we go into the night -- or into the light? Do our narratives about religion, science, art, the natural world, or the power of love sustain us or do they fall away at the end?  \r\n\r\nInto The Night: Darkness and Light, however, stands on its own, presenting the stories of nine fascinating men and women from various walks of life who are grappling with these questions: young and old, believers and unbelievers, dying and healthy. Each has been shocked into mortality -- and has been forever changed, their dramatic, life-changing experiences revealing as much about life as about death. Among them: a longevity scientist pushing back against death; a transhumanist who believes humans can be designed to live indefinitely; a Native American physician with stage four cancer who finds strength in the rituals of her Comanche grandmother; an Orthodox Jewish Director of Ancient texts at Harvard who is forced by his cancer diagnosis to reconsider his own relationship to God; a well-known photographer who comes to  realize that love, not art, will be his legacy; and two American Buddhist monks whose mission is to be fully present to the dying.  However varied their backgrounds, these men and women are united by their uncommon eloquence and intelligence.  \r\n\r\nViewers will leave \"Into The Night: Darkness and Light\" enlivened, even exhilarated, seeing death, in the words of one participant, \"as the gateway to a fuller, more conscious life.\"  \r\n\r\n\"Into The Night: Darkness and Light\" is produced by Oscar-nominated and Emmy and Peabody award-winning film producer, director and writer Helen Whitney and narrated by Sharon Stone.",

      "ProgramSummary": "This documentary project will shed light on the little-known history of plantations and the enslaved in North Florida. In creating a visually compelling story that explores the history of a people who contributed so much to what Leon county is today, it can advance a sense of place and identity for hundreds of thousands of African-Americans. It is our goal to both show the invisible history of slavery in Leon County and the environs and to trace its economic, social and political effect on our community today. In addition, this documentary will be a useful tool in educating our communities and engaging important conversations.\r\n\r\nLeon County was considered the heart of the cotton plantation belt in Florida. It contained the most-dense collection of medium to large plantations. In 1860, there were 75 large plantations with each one having at least 30 slaves. In addition there were 146 plantations that had 500 or more acres. Some of these had 100 or more slaves on the plantations as well. In fact, in 1830 Leon was the most populated county in Florida with an approximately equal number of white and blacks. By 1860 the number of enslaved would have risen to 70%25. Indeed the domestic slave trade in Florida was centered in Leon. At least two prominent slave traders operated in Tallahassee and or Leon County, Paterson and Hughes and T. R. McClintock. Often these traders would advertise these auctions in local papers. Beneath the feet of Leon County and Tallahassee residents and visitors are the remains of this same plantation environment. . It is clearly important to create awareness of the damaging social economic and political legacies that are rooted in slavery.",

By focusing on the people who live and work in these watery places with slower paces, the series invites viewers to slow down and take part in the giddy rapture of new cultural experiences.   In Season 3, host Kira Cook explores the unique culture and people of New York's Fire Island, Santa Catalina in California, Mexico's Holbox and Hydra in Greece.  The food traditions and behind-the-scenes stories about filming the series are also presented. ",

What’s less known about Italy is the diversity and turbulence of the geology behind all of this abundance: the continuously erupting volcanoes, the violent earthquakes, the clash of mighty tectonic plates, and the rising of the mountains from which Michelangelo sourced his famous marbles. \r\n\r\nItaly’s Mystery Mountains ties the country’s rich artistic culture to its turbulent geologic story, following two international teams of geologists determined to resolve a hotly debated issue: are the Apennines still alive and growing in the north? With the answer to this question the fascinating story of the Italian peninsula will fall into place and geologists may better understand where future earthquakes might strike this highly unstable land.  ",

      "ProgramSummary": "Ivan Doig (1939-2015) mined his hardscrabble Montana childhood to create an iconic body of literary work. His captivating and at times heart-breaking narratives embody the harshness and beauty of the western landscape, draw upon his experience as journalist and historian, and celebrate the grit required for his beloved characters to survive in challenging social and physical climates. His dedication to language, people and place has made him one of the most influential and celebrated authors of the American West.\r\nDoig rejected caricatures and stereotypes of the West that dominated film, television, and works of fiction. Instead, he honored the ordinary heroes who raised families and built communities despite inhospitable circumstances. His tender and poetic portrayals of hard-working characters and the landscapes they inhabited resulted in an award-winning memoir, critically acclaimed novels, and national best-sellers.\r\nDoigâ€™s literary philosophy is perhaps best summed up in his own words, \"If I have any creed that I wish you as readers, necessary accomplices in this flirtatious ceremony of writing and reading, will take with you from my pages, it'd be this belief of mine that writers of caliber can ground their work in specific land and lingo and yet be writing of that larger country: life.\"\r\n",

Jack heeded his country's call after the attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into World War II. In 1942, he enlisted and served as a decorated Navy Hellcat pilot in the skies over the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nThen, like so many others of the \"Greatest Generation,\" Jack returned home to raise his family and start a business. Lessons learned in the Navy - including the values of integrity, hard work, team spirit, and simply doing the right thing - helped shape his personality. They also made their mark on the company he founded in 1957, Enterprise Rent a Car. He named his new business after the aircraft carrier he served on, the most decorated American ship in WWII, the USS Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe incredible story of a World War II veteran utilizing the lessons he took home from war to establish one of America's most successful post-war companies.",

Escaping oppression and poverty, Jewish families joined other settlers in search of a better life. By the early 1900s, over 100,000 Jews put down roots in the Wild West, from Guggenheim and Levi Strauss who built their fortunes via grit and fortitude, to everyday merchants and cattlemen. A young Golda Meir spent formative years in Denver, and notorious Wyatt Earp, Bronco Bill and Pancho Villa had Jewish connections. Fascinating interviews and a trove of archival materials recall the legacy and pioneering spirit of those who definitively shaped westward expansion. ",

Through the lens of journalists working in Dallas in 1963, audiences will learn about the moment-by-moment experiences of those who covered one of the most significant events in U.S. history. Their reflections also allow us to witness the remarkable rise of television as a primary source for breaking news coverage. Narrated by Jane Pauley, the documentary also reveals the tremendous technical obstacles that had to be overcome and the immediate journalistic decisions that accompanied the initial live remote broadcasts generated by television four decades ago.

Contortionist face and actor of the digital revolution he surfed on the last golden age of the cartoon before the takeover by Disney-Marvel franchises in Hollywood. He was the pulling face of the Clinton years, the link between Charlie Chaplin and Roger Rabbit, the last explosion of dumb laugh before the 9/11 depression. Now that Donald Trump, his intimate enemy, stole his role as a toon, what place can Jim Carrey still find on screens where comedy is in decline? \r\nMuch more than a doc for film buffs, this is a vibrant reminder of a lighthearted  era where grotesque and foolish was never too much for Jim Carrey’ Comedies and were the fools were only actors…not Presidents!   Welcome  into the untamable and outrageous world of the artist who played the Dumb and the Kingfools!\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "Jimi Hendrix: Electric Church presents the legendary guitarist in full flight at the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival before the largest US audience of his career. This critically acclaimed film combined color, 16mm multi-camera footage of Hendrix’s unforgettable July 4, 1970 concert in its original performance sequence together with a new documentary that traces his journey to the festival amidst the dark shadow of civil rights unrest, the unrelenting toll of the Vietnam War and a burgeoning festival culture that drew together young people across the country who were inspired by the Woodstock festival. \r\nThe film contains breathtaking, color 16mm footage of Jimi Hendrix’s Independence Day appearance, a mere ten weeks before his untimely passing. Standout performances include such Hendrix classics as “Hey Joe,” “Voodoo Child (Slight Return),” “Purple Haze,” as well as confident, compelling versions of songs such as “Room Full Of Mirrors,” “Freedom,” and “Straight Ahead” that had not yet been issued by Jimi on an Experience album, but were intended to be part of the album he was working on that summer. “Star Spangled Banner,” played against a backdrop of exploding fireworks, is another highlight.”",

      "ProgramSummary": "1201 - The Best of Taiwan\r\nWhy Taiwan? That is a question uninitiated visitors to Taiwan may ask. Beginning with\r\nits Portuguese discoverers, who called it Isla Formosa, Beautiful Isle; they will soon find\r\nthere is much in Taiwan to enjoy. With close to 1,000 miles of coastline to stroll, 286\r\nmountain peaks over 9,000 feet to climb, 10 islands to explore, countless festivals to\r\ncelebrate and 14 aboriginal groups to meet, Taiwan is a wondrous land with an\r\nabundance of surprising things to do, see and experience. Joseph has covered the\r\nisland from every angle. He's taken in the island by rail, reveled in its natural treasures,\r\nsampled its unique foods and drinks, combed through its night markets, explored its\r\nislands, participated in spiritual and cultural festivals and celebrated with its people. In\r\nhis latest Taiwan episode Joseph dips into his previous Taiwan adventures and\r\nanswers the question, \"Why Taiwan.\"\r\n\r\n1202 - Halloween in Ireland's Ancient East\r\nThe Irish are a celebratory people ready to rejoice life at the beat of a drum, a note from\r\na song and a burst of laughter. Joseph joins the party when he celebrates Halloween in\r\nIreland's Ancient East, an area rich in history, myths and legends, and views this\r\nbeautiful part of the island through the prism of two festivals. The Puca Festival is an\r\nancient observance reborn and the Wexford Festival Opera illustrates Ireland's diverse\r\nnature and love of community. At the Puca Festival Joseph joins the commemoration\r\nof the Celtic New Year, Samhain (pronounced Sow-In), which dates back more than\r\n2,500 years. At the Wexford Opera Festival he spotlights the festival's 68 years of\r\nfeaturing unknown national and international composers with the support of more than\r\n400 community volunteers. In between the festivities, Joseph samples a taste of the\r\nisland in castles, country homes, markets, pubs and restaurants. It's clear that Ireland\r\nhas much to celebrate - its heritage and culture, its struggles and survival, its scenic\r\nbeauty and natural attractions -- and we're all invited to join in the revelry.\r\n\r\n1203 - South Africa - Into the Wild!\r\nJoseph heads back to his first African adventure when he safaris through South Africa\r\nfor close encounters with its animals and people. His journey begins in Cape Town,\r\nSouth Africa's mother city, so called because it's the country's oldest city. Then in the\r\nshadow of the city's landmark Table Mountain, he visits South Africa's oldest wine\r\ncountry and samples some of South Africa's finest wines. While we can expect to find\r\nlions and elephants on Joseph's African journey, at the Cape of Good Hope Joseph\r\nalso introduces us to ostriches and a colony of three thousand African Penguins. The\r\nclimax of the episode is Joseph's safari at Shamwari Game Reserve, a 61,000 acre\r\npreserve. Surrounded by the multitude of Shamwari's amazing animal residents is as\r\ninspiring as his experience Alicedale, an abandoned rail town on the edge of the\r\nreserve. There he learns that sustainable tourism, attracted by the reserve, has given\r\nthe people new hope. Joseph's South African journey teaches us that although\r\npredators kill by instinct, people choose whether to attack or embrace each other and\r\nchoice is what makes us human and allows us to celebrate our connection.\r\n\r\n1204 - Alaska - America's Last Frontier\r\nJoseph looks back to his first voyage through Alaska's Inside Passage to the land and\r\nthe people of America's Last Frontier. His ocean-going vessel carries him through\r\nCanadian Waters to Prince Rupert, BC and on through Alaska's inside passage to\r\nJuneau, Skagway and Sitka. Along the way the ship stops in Tracy Arm Fjord to catch\r\nnature's show headlined by Bald Eagles and Gray, Orca and Humpback\r\nwhales. Further explorations take him to Alaska's capital, Juneau and while no roads\r\nlead to Juneau visitors still come to trek its glaciers, kayak its rivers and ski its\r\nmountains. Joseph's Alaskan journey of discovery continues in the Klondike Gold\r\nRush town of Skagway and in historic Sitka where he explores its Russian\r\nroots. During his Inside Passage journey he meets the Tsimshian people and learns of\r\ntheir struggle to retain their language, rich culture and ancient ceremonies. Alaska is\r\nAmerica's Last Frontier and every Alaskan has a story to tell about what brought them\r\nand what keeps them there. In the end, Joseph discovers that they came for the land,\r\nbut they stayed for the people.\r\n\r\n1205 - Thailand - Beaches and Festivals\r\nJoseph and Julie revisit Thailand and take in its beautiful beaches and colorful\r\nfestivals. Whether in town or on a tropical isle, during Joseph and Julie's visits to\r\nThailand they've experienced both the natural and the cultural sides of the\r\ncountry. Thailand - the land of smiles - is famous for having some of the most\r\npicturesque beaches in the world. Much of its white sand, warm water coast lines the\r\nshores of its more than 1,400 islands, including Koh Samui, Phi Phi and\r\nPhuket. Thailand's islands are invitations to the world-weary traveler to lay back and\r\nrelax among accommodations that range from the luxurious to the exotic and are\r\nsurrounded by spectacular scenery and a world of activities and attractions. On this\r\njourney they kayak through a mangrove forest, enjoy underwater views of tropical fish,\r\nand then head north to Chang Mai, the city of temples. There they visit holy temples,\r\nparticipate in Monk chats and join in the annual Loy Krathong festival where fireworks\r\nand 5,000 floating paper lanterns are part of the celebration.\r\n\r\n1206 - South Padre Island, TX\r\nJoseph heads to South Padre Island for a host of activities that highlight the many\r\npleasures available to visitors to the longest barrier island on the South Texas Coast.\r\nBesides enjoying the local's favorite pastime of kicking' back and breathing in the sweet\r\nsea breezes, Joseph partakes of the islands' many natural and manmade\r\nattractions. From fishing to bird watching, from building sand castles to kayaking the\r\nlagoon and hitting the surf, Joseph joins in the fun. A highlight of his visit is a hatchling\r\nrelease with South Padre Island Sea Turtle, Inc. ",

      "ProgramSummary": "\r\nSynopsis\r\n\r\nJourneys of Black Mathematicians: Forging Resilience (2024) 58 minutes\r\n\r\nJourneys of Black Mathematicians: Forging Resilience is the first of two documentary films produced by Zala Films as part of the Journeys of Black Mathematicians project started in collaboration with SLMath (MSRI) in 2020.\r\n\r\nForging Resilience traces the evolution of a culture of Black scholars, scientists and educators. The film follows the stories of prominent pioneers, showing how the challenges they faced and their triumphs are reflected in the experiences of today's mid-career Black mathematicians. Their mathematical descendants in turn are contemporary college students, and K-12 children across the U.S. who are learning that they belong in mathematics and STEM.\r\n\r\nWith over 50 individuals featured, the film is a panoramic survey starting with the first Black Ph.D., Edward Bouchet (1877) and W. W. S. Claytor, extraordinary exemplars from the early and mid-20th century who prepared the way for several of the trailblazers filmed for this project. The oldest of these is Virginia K. Newell (born in 1917), followed by Evelyn Boyd Granville, the second Black woman to earn her Ph.D. in mathematics, who died in 2023 at the age of 99.\r\n\r\nNewell recalls a history where Blacks were not allowed to study reading and writing and describes her own efforts to introduce trigonometry in North Carolina schools. Evelyn Granville's path was different, a charmed passage through Smith and Yale to IBM and an exciting career of research in the space program.\r\n\r\nDespite Granville's example, the educational and career opportunities for Black students in mathematics was often strewn with obstructions. Like many others who grew up in the 1940s and 1950s in the southern United States, mathematician and physicist Ronald Mickens resolved to get out of Virginia for college. He got his Ph.D. at Vanderbilt University, and continued his work at MIT. He has important contributions in numerous fields, and created one and a half himselfâ€”Nonstandard Finite Difference Schemes.\r\n\r\nFreeman Hrabowski III grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and was arrested during the civil rights protests of 1963 as a child. A president emeritus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), he is a tireless advocate of expanding mathematics education to under-represented communities.\r\n\r\nScott Williams describes how Black college students in Baltimore fought for the integration of a local movie theater in the 1960s through protest. Williams went on to earn his PhD in mathematics and embarked on a stellar career at the University of Buffalo. His education led through Morgan State, one of the four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) featured in the film. Earl Barnes, a classmate of Williams at Morgan State, grew up in the south where he overheard White hunters threatening to shoot Black people if their children were forced to attend an integrated school. Barnes went north, and after Morgan State, had a long and successful career with IBM. Following that he returned to academia, first at Georgia Tech, then at Morgan State.\r\n\r\nThe role of HBCUs in producing Black mathematicians is a central theme. Sections on Morgan State, Howard University, Spelman College and Morehouse College connect the featured individuals in threads of mentorship stretching back to the 1940s. Akil Parker is an example of how the influence of an HBCU spreads to the community through its graduates. Parker, a Morgan State alumnus, runs a math tutoring program called All This Math, while his classmate Dontae Ryan has launched a math tutoring program with his wife Antoynica in Baltimore that is featured in the film. Parker quotes the activist educator Bob Moses, who said that \"mathematics education is a number one civil rights issue of the 21st century.\" Both Parker and the Ryans maintain close ties to Morgan State.\r\n\r\nZerotti Woods, a research mathematician, is a product of Morehouse College. He grew up in  the rough and tough Cleveland Avenue neighborhood in Atlanta. At Morehouse he vacillated. \"When I came in to Morehouse, 18 years old, I still hadn't made a choice if I was going to be an outlaw, or if I was going to go the straight and narrow, and going to be the schoolboy,\" Woods says in the film. He was suspended for a year, and it was only because Morehouse math teachers like Duane Cooper recognized his talent that he was able to return and eventually succeed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning and end of the film, Woods, who now manages a research team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, talks to children at the Rosel Fann Recreation Center in his old neighborhood. Woods attended the same rec center as a child. After convincing the children that although he is one of them, he is in fact a research mathematician, Woods explains. \"A lot of people in this world are going to tell you that you can't. And I'm a person that looks like you, and I'm going to tell you that you can.\"\r\n\r\nAt every HBCU covered in the film, the role of an outstanding teacher is stressed by their students, who are today responsible for advancing the math and science programs at the schools. At Spelman College Etta Falconer produced at least two generations of women who are now leaders in the field. Spelman alumna and faculty who credit Falconer for paving the way for Black women in math include Sylvia Bozeman, with her own legacy as a force in producing new mathematicians, to Talitha Washington, director of the Data Science Initiative at the Atlanta University Center Consortium, in addition to being president of American Women in Mathematics (AWM), and numerous other positions; and Emille Davie Lawrence, an associate professor of mathematics at the University of San Francisco. They are transmitting and adding to the legacy received from Falconer, as it flows through them to current students. One of these followed in the film is Janiah Kyle, who was in the Spelman class of 2023.\r\n\r\nAt Morehouse College the math department was built by C. B. Dansby (1897-1973). One of his students, Johnny Houston, tells us that he first went to Morehouse \"because I had never seen a Black professor with a Ph.D. in mathematics.\" Houston went on to earn his doctorate at Purdue. In 1969 he attended the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM), the largest annual professional conference for mathematicians in the United States. Of the 3,600 participants, Houston met fewer than 25 Blacks. He discovered that they shared the experiences of being excluded from numerous groups and activities, and they resolved to demand change. Among them was Scott Williams, who along with Houston and Jim Donaldson of Howard University, founded the National Association of Mathematicians (NAM). The growth of NAM led to a key annual eventâ€”NAM's MathFest. At the 2022 edition held at Morgan State University in Baltimore, professors brought their talented undergraduates to present their work to an audience of other Black mathematicians, and to meet recruiters from graduate schools and a range of companies and government agencies. \r\n\r\nAmong these professors was Howard University's Dennis Davenport. We meet two of his students at MathFest. Destin Davis tells us that before taking a class from Davenport at Howard, he had never met a Black math teacher. Ashlyn Lee, a sophomore at Howard who hails from Bermuda, is encouraged by the fact that suddenly she is surrounded by so many people like her who love mathematics. Several participants describe MathFest as being among the most formative experiences of their education.\r\n\r\nOne of the presenters at MathFest is Janiah Kyle from Spelman. She had interned with mathematical epidemiologist Abba Gumel on a project aimed at generating predictive models for the spread of malaria. Her presentation is met by several invitations to graduate school, and an offer from Zerotti Woods to join his team at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins.\r\n\r\nProminent among the recruiters at MathFest is the National Security Agency (NSA), perhaps the largest employer of mathematicians anywhere. Mel Currie is a retired NSA mathematician who greatly expanded the number of Black and Native American mathematicians at the agency. In the film he eloquently explains the need for talented people with a strong ethical sense to participate in the work conducted by intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the mathematicians in the film, such as Morgan State's Asamoah Nkwanta, and University of San Francisco's Emille Davie Lawrence, work in pure mathematics, the intersection of academia and applied mathematics holds the most opportunities for employment. Bonita Saunders is an example of someone who took her Ph.D. to a career at the National institute of Standards (NIST). Tasha Inniss, Associate Provost for Research at Spelman College, worked at the FAA, modeling aircraft landing patterns during inclement weather. Among the most impressive applications presented is the wide-ranging work of Abba Gumel, a world-renowned expert on the mathematical theory of epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe search for ways to bring future generations into the mathematical fold is a central theme for almost all of those portrayed. There are arguments for cultural change, as advocated by Freeman Hrabowski III, and descriptions of ongoing exclusion from the wider mathematical community as evidenced by the stories of Edray Goins and Omayra Ortega, who describe experiences of isolation at predominantly white institutions. At the same time, William Massey of Princeton University, the founder of the Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS), cautions that the drive for more equity and inclusion must not occur at the expense of \"skills and drills, the skills you have to develop, and if you don't do that, you're not really going to understand what's going on,\" he explains.\r\n\r\nAlong with MathFest, one program targeting undergraduates with a summer research experience that prepares them for graduate school is the Mathematical Sciences\r\nResearch Institute Undergraduate Program (MSRI-UP), where 18 students are brought to Berkeley for six weeks during which they work on unsolved problems. Among those in the 2022 edition of MSRI-UP is Elijah Leake, a Chicago area student on the cusp of graduating from DePaul University. He has embraced, dropped and returned to mathematics in the course of his undergraduate education. What he chooses to pursue will be followed in film two of Journeys of Black Mathematicians. The careers and choices of other students we have met in Forging Resilience will also be followed.\r\n\r\nToday's African-American students have more opportunities to engage with mathematics than any of their predecessors had. Yet there are powerful headwinds: lingering racial prejudice and internal cultural resistance to math and STEM in the community, are just two. \"As African-Americans it can be tough in this society,\" Tasha Inniss explains. \"We may get knocked down, but we will rise. Resilience is our middle name.\" Johnny Houston goes further. \"The issue is not what is possible, what is available,\" he says. \"The issue is what do you want to do, and what are you willing to commit yourself to do?\"\r\n\r\nAbout the production\r\n\r\nPlans for what to film were developed in consultation with mathematicians Edray Goins and Johnny Houston. Both had been active in the National Association of Mathematicians (NAM) and had a good grasp of the history of African-Americans in mathematics, as well as of the individuals and institutions with important stories to tell.\r\n\r\nProduction on Journeys of Black Mathematicians began in 2020 at the height of the covid epidemic. The first to be interviewed was Scott Williams, a founder of NAM, who had retired from SUNY Buffalo. Living in California, George Csicsery, the producer/director, was not allowed into New York state in September 2020 due to covid restrictions. He met Williams in Erie, Pennsylvania. For this first interview he was joined by Albert Lewis of the Educational Advancement Foundation (EAF). Other interviews conducted over the following months with Virginia Newell and Evelyn Granville were filmed with local cameraman at the subjects' homes, and the rest of the production crew participating remotely via Zoom. \r\n\r\nThe core production crew, consisting of George Csicsery producing/directing, cinematographer Ashley James, and William McNeill, assistant cameraman, started filming interviews in 2021. Over three years, the film crew traveled to the Baltimore-Washington area twice, and to Atlanta twice. There were three different trips to Southern California, several shoots in Berkeley and San Francisco, and a week of shooting in Chicago and Indiana in 2023.\r\n\r\nAll told over 60 interviews were filmed for the two-film series, with additional shoots in classrooms, conferences, and at the homes of several subjects. The project's lead consultant, Dr. Johnny Houston, played a major role in contacting participants and scheduling them for most of the production that took place in Georgia, Baltimore-Washington, in Chicago and at Purdue.\r\n\r\nEditing began with the review of the footage from each shoot, and a rigorous selection process. Actual editing of the first film, Forging Resilience, began in earnest in July 2023 with editor Tal Skloot working with the director through completion of the final cut in December 2023. The research and acquisition of dozens of stills and archival images was pursued simultaneously. Animated sequences of mathematical ideas and some graphics were created by Andrea Hale, who also designed the film title sequence, poster and postcard.\r\n\r\nThe music in Journeys of Black Mathematicians: Forging Resilience includes classical pieces by composers Nathaniel Dett (1882-1943) and Oswald Russell (1933-2012). The majority of the music cues were composed by San Francisco composer and musician Marcus Shelby, whose \"work focuses on the history, present, and future of African American lives, social movements and music education.\" One additional composition is by composer Alex Lu.\r\n",

      "ProgramSummary": "\"Keeper of the Flame\" is a feature-length documentary film about the life and work of human rights activist Jack Healey. Working for a decade at the forefront of human rights as the director of Amnesty International USA, Healey played a major role in bringing human rights to a televised national and international public, through the fusing of popular music and activism, collaborating with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Sting, and Wynton Marsalis. Tracking Healey's activism back to the Civil Rights Movement, the film lays the groundwork for his lifelong commitment to human rights work. Learning from and working with the likes of Dick Gregory, Fannie Lou Hamer, Father James Groppi and John Lewis, Healey's activist spirit is visible in the midst of Apartheid in South Africa, in his fight to bring global human rights violations to the news media, and in his continuing demands for the release of Native American activist Leonard Peltier. Healey demonstrates the importance of knowing history, the importance of staying aware and educated, of speaking up, and the importance of looking ahead. \"Keeper of the Flame\" shows what a life of activism entails, questions what it means and how it's done, and presents Healey's ten lessons in activism.

      "ProgramSummary": "     Chef Kevin Belton is ready to hit the trail, the culinary trail that is, in a new cooking series from WYES-TV. In his fourth public television venture, Chef Belton will explore the rich and multi-faceted foodways of Louisiana on Kevin Belton's Cookin' Louisiana, a tasty 26-part tour of the Pelican State's best flavors and dishes.    \r\n     The award-winning chef will visit locations across the state for a look at the authentic food traditions of Louisiana cuisine. The road trip will start in Lafourche Parish, an area southwest from New Orleans where the chef's French speaking grandmother grew up and where the catch of the day is sourced from the 106 miles of bayou that weave through the parish. \r\n    Chef Belton's Louisiana road trip will take him from the River Parishes, where the region's German heritage influences its food culture, to Acadia Parish where he'll \"have a rice day\" in a locale known as the Rice Capital of America. In Sabine Parish the chef will sample tamales in a pocket of Spanish culture dating back to the 18th century. And in Arnaudville, a city that rests on the border of St. Landry and St. Martin Parishes, he'll go in search of the Cajun Kevin Po Boy, an upright seafood and sausage stuffed sandwich inspired by the cypress knees of the bayou. \r\n     Back in the studio, Chef Belton will prepare his take on the outstanding dishes of the state. He'll salute the Crawfish Capital of Louisiana with a flavored packed Crawfish Burger and sample the bounty of the Sportsman's Paradise with Savory Sweet Quail with Grilled Peaches. \r\n     In his travels, the chef will seek out dishes that reflect Louisiana's complex blending of cultures, preparing Filipino-style Beef Tapa with Sinangag (Garlic Fried Rice), Hungarian Stuffed Cabbage Rolls and traditional Czech Kolaches. He'll also dip into the bounty of Louisiana's food culture with dishes that reflect its prolific fisheries, its citrus harvest and its thriving family friendly \"you pick\" farm experiences. Chef Kevin will even give a shout out to Louisiana's state beverage, milk, with a BLT Cheesecake featuring Creole cream cheese. \r\n     From Chicken and Dumplings, one of the Delta Delights from Northeast Louisiana, to Cracklins Cornbread from Evangeline Parish in the Cajun Heartland, Kevin Belton's Cookin' Louisiana will take viewers on a fun-filled food odyssey with the 6'9\"gregarious chef.  \r\n\r\n",
